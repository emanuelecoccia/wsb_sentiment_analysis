A,flzwq3,2020-03-20 19:22:23,A Brief Introduction To Stocks And Options For My Fellow Degenerates,"I know the vast majority of people here are beautiful minds and don't need this, but maybe this can help the newcomers build upon what they already know.  Since stock investing is a straightforward concept, we'll build upon that to explain how options trading works. If you prefer to read a version with inline images, that can be found [here](https://www.karma.fm/p/53IhuQS/stocks-and-options-for-dummies).

## Going ""Long"" on Stocks

Going ""long"" on a stock means that if the price goes up, your profits go up. Up = good, down = bad.

When you buy a share, you create a sort of **contract** with a stock exchange. This contract is stored on their internal, proprietary database: their ledger.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Mack Doodle, and I own one share of $FOO, purchased at $100. I have the right to sell it to a buyer at any point in the future, at a price determined by the market."" The contract is executed instantly. It's kind of like a game:

[https://i.imgur.com/Gowsqzv.png](https://i.imgur.com/Gowsqzv.png)

## Shorting a stock

Shorting a stock is the opposite ""going long"". If the price goes down when you're holding a short position, your profits go up.

Here's how shorting works¬π: Given a share price of $100 that you expect to drop, you can effectively borrow $100 from a broker and promise to pay it back in the form of one share. If the price drops, you can buy a share using this borrowed money and give it to the broker. You gain the difference.

*¬π: Technically, it's a bit more complicated. The above simplification is a heuristic I use because it's conceptually accurate. You actually borrow stock, not cash. If you short 100 shares of $TSLA, the broker lets you borrow 100 shares from someone else's account and sells them on your behalf, finally giving you the cash. You're then on the hook for those 100 shares at some point in the future - you have to cover your short position. If TSLA goes down, you can buy them at a lower price and make money on that delta.*

When you're short and price increases, you either wait for it to come back down, or you eat the losses and buy a share at the higher price using the borrowed money plus some of your own money before giving it back to the broker. You'd lose the difference.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Mack Doodle, and I have borrowed $100 from you with the promise of paying you back in the form of one $FOO share, currently valued at $100. I am on the hook to eventually get my hands on a share for you at any point in the future. If the price of one $FOO share increases to $120, I will have to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy a portion of that share, and then $20 of my own money to buy the rest of the share. I will then give you the share at a personal loss of 20%. If the price of one $FOO share decreases to $80, I will be able to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy an entire share, and then keep the extra $20 for myself."" This game is similar to the first, but flipped:

[https://i.imgur.com/vkAENZX.png](https://i.imgur.com/vkAENZX.png)

Short means ""up is bad; down is good"". Each of these instruments allow you to engage with the market through a contract that records the following:

    Contract Type: Purchase Stock
    ----------------------------
    Wallet ID: Mack Doodle
    Ticker symbol: $FOO
    Price at time of contract creation: $100
    Price at time of contract execution: $100
    Number of shares: 1
    Buying or selling: Buying
    Date contract signed: Just now
    Date contract executed: Just now (manual execution)

## Limit and Stop Orders

The Price at time of time of contract execution doesn't have to be the current price, though. If you $FOO is currently priced at $100 and you want to go long when it hits $120 because you anticipate an upward breakout at that price, you can place a ""buy stop order"". If you want to go short when $FOO hits $120 because you anticipate a downward correction, you can place a ""sell stop order"". Even if the price of $FOO is $100, you can purchase the following contract:

    Contract Type: Buy Stop Order
    ----------------------------
    Wallet ID: Bobby Ronson
    Ticker symbol: $FOO
    Price at time of contract creation: $100
    Price at time of contract execution: $120 [New!]
    Number of shares: 1
    Buying or selling: Buying
    Date contract signed: Just now
    Date contract executed: TBD (by price action) [New!]

This contract, in contrast to the first, will only execute if and when the price equals $120. It's a more nuanced game, but not all that different from the two we've seen so far:

[https://i.imgur.com/8oABtgj.png](https://i.imgur.com/8oABtgj.png)

Once the share price trips the wire of your limit, the contract is executed just like the very first game we played.

This isn't commonly used by retail investors (like you and me), but this concept is used frequently by quant/algo funds.

## Options

An option is a slightly more complex instrument.

The simple rule is that if a share price moves away from a specific value *by a specific time*, you profit. Note the added dimension of gameplay - a time limit. This compresses your confidence down into a timeframe, which translates to much higher risk, and also much higher reward. I think of options as facilitating *aggressive investing* \- not just gambling. Though I think all investing becomes gambling at *some* timescale.

## Going long with a call option

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb beyond $120 by November 5th, you may purchase the option to ""purchase a share‚Ää-‚Ääor *call it into your wallet*‚Ää\-‚Ääfor $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price increases from $100 to $200 sometime between now and November 5th, you can exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price never hits $120, and instead falls to a November 5th price of $40, you aren't obligated to do anything; you can opt to eat the cost of the option. Here's what the options game looks like:

[https://i.imgur.com/SOXPdlG.png](https://i.imgur.com/SOXPdlG.png)

## Going short with a put option

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb no higher than $120 by November 5th, you may buy the option to ""sell a share (or put it out of your wallet) for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price falls to a November 5th price of $40, you can then exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price rockets up to $200, you're under no obligations and only have to eat the relatively small cost of the option.

Note that if the price never hits break-even, you're responsible for your loss of principal; it's not like there's no downside.

[https://i.imgur.com/6klYYGN.png](https://i.imgur.com/6klYYGN.png)

Options and stocks are two different types of financial instruments that are traded in two different markets. The price that you pay for an option is determined by supply and demand, in the same way that the price of a share is determined by supply and demand. The supply and demand for an option is derived from the supply and demand of the underlying shares. This is why options are referred to as derivative instruments. They're higher up on the value funnel; they're more volatile; there's more potential for dramatic gains and losses:

[https://i.imgur.com/F0fhVeC.png](https://i.imgur.com/F0fhVeC.png)

Here's what an option contract looks like:

    Contract Type: Buy Call Option
    ----------------------------
    Wallet ID: Mack Doodle
    Ticker symbol: $FOO
    Price at time of contract creation: $100
    Price at time of contract execution: $120 [""strike price""]
    Number of shares: 100 [1 contract = 100 shares]
    Buying or selling: ""Buying"" [Buying a call option = long]
    Date contract signed: Just now
    Date contract executed: TBD [See Note]
    Date contract expires: November 5th [New!]
    Option price: $200 [New!]

Once you hold an option contract, you can do three things with it: You can manually exercise it at any time before the expiry; it can automatically be exercised by the broker at expiry; you can sell the contract back into the market.

Let's look at an example using a real stock: Tesla.

Let's suppose that I have $10,000 that I would like to invest in Tesla, and that I'm so confident in Tesla that I'm willing to throw it all away on a highly leveraged, optimistic bet. At the time of this writing, $TSLA was trading at $221. I expect it to be far above $221 by Q4 2019. Here are my games:

**Game 1: Going long with stocks**

* I can buy 10,000 / 221 = \~45 shares
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of just over $221 since the ""price to play"" is simply the $5 trade commission that my broker charges me.
* Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose $10,000.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 and I earn (400‚Äì221) \* 45 or \~$8,000 (or potentially much more‚Ää-‚Äästocks have no time limits)
* My max loss is $10,000, or 100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~80%.

&#x200B;

**Game 2: Going long with options**

The $225 December strike price will cost about $35 per share:

[https://i.imgur.com/06NgPMX.png](https://i.imgur.com/06NgPMX.png)

&#x200B;

* I have the market power equivalent of 10,000 / 35 = \~285 shares, or just under 3 contracts. (partial contracts are not allowed, but for this example, let's suppose they are)
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of 221 + $35 option price = \~$256. If the price breaks $256 between now and December, I'm golden.
* Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose the $10,000 option contract.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 by December and I earn (400‚Äì225) \* 285 or \~$50,000
* My max loss is $10,000‚Äì100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~500%.

Options magnify my potential reward while also magnifying the potential for losses; Tesla dipping 20% means I lose 100% of my principal.

Here's my ""contract"", in this case:

    Contract Type: Buy Call Option
    Wallet ID: Mack Doodle 
    Ticker symbol: $TSLA 
    Price at time of contract creation: $221 
    Price at time of contract execution: $225 [""strike price""] 
    Number of shares: 285 Buying or selling: ""Buying"" [Buying a call option = long] 
    Date contract signed: Just now 
    Date contract executed: TBD 
    Date contract expires: December 20th 
    Option price: $10,000

&#x200B;

That's about it! Keep in mind that this is a game, and our nationalized financial industry employs some of the most clever and greedy gamblers out there. The house generally wins, but just like poker - with the right mental models, discipline, and risk appetite, you can come out far ahead. It's not unlike poker in that self-education and exercise translate to vastly improved odds at the table.

The Trump administration is asking state labor officials to delay releasing the precise number of unemployment claims they are fielding, an indication of how uneasy policymakers are about further roiling a stock market already plunging in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

In an email sent Wednesday, the Labor Department instructed state officials to only ‚Äúprovide information using generalities to describe claims levels (very high, large increase)‚Äù until the department releases the total number of national claims next Thursday.

The email, which was shared with The New York Times, noted that the reports were monitored closely by financial markets and should therefore remain embargoed. ‚ÄúStates should not provide numeric values to the public,‚Äù wrote Gay Gilbert, the administrator of the department‚Äôs Office of Employment Insurance.""

Thanks to me UPRO and TMF now are 50% stress tests on TOS, no margin reduction credit, and from 36% and 24% stress tests respectively. Or maybe I'm on reg-t when I took the screenshot, IDK and IDC. Talking with risk management apparently I flew under the radar as they didn't see a margin balance due to the box spread until other account alerts went off as customer service will take a look in when anyone is negative 1 million or more PnL as a courtesy to chat with their clients. Needless to say customer service was horrified and I got another margin phone call to wire in $1,250,000 in the next five minutes or they'd liquidate. I guess they give Portfolio Margin customers a little bit more leeway... 

I took the five minutes to grab this one final screenshot. I'm hoping for some bailout money from coronavirus too. 

I talked with the bankruptcy lawyer that set me up with the asset protection plan and he already dropped me as a client. I never imagined beer-virus would do this to me. 

I'm gonna take some time to just not think about the virus or anything else.

* A triple witching hour on average corresponds to a 90% increase in market volume.

* A triple witching hour has only happened 15 times in a bear market since 1985. 

* Those 15 times it has finished red 10 times with an average change of -0.53%. 

* The biggest drop was -2.48% in June of 2000 and the biggest gain was 3.35% in September of 2009.

I‚Äôm sure, at this point, you‚Äôre familiar w/ the term Quantitative Easing and what it means. 

The Fed, as of last night, reopened the Primary Dealer Credit Facility. This facility takes in commercial paper and other interest rate related products and in exchange issues loans (now at a zero rate). Except they added one extra thing... very quietly...


https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200317b1.pdf

The Fed is prohibited from purchasing securities in the market. 

However, that pdf is the 2020 release laying out the groundwork for the PDCF‚Äôs rules and guidelines. 

They added EQUITIES to the list of things they can accept as collateral in exchange for issuing zero interest loans to companies. They backdoored their way into propping up the stock markets by being able to acquire stocks indirectly.


Which means Starbucks, who started share buybacks up again today, can turn around and give the shares they bought back to the Fed, and receive a zero interest loan from the Fed.

This is massive. This was NOT a part of the PDCF‚Äôs abilities in 2008. Basically, the PPT has found out how to go mainstream. It will take a bit for this to work it‚Äôs way into the system but it is out there.",DD,0.95

But all the casinos and other large properties have to close.  Not sure how they plan to do that.  These hotels have a couple of hundred-thousand people in them at any time.

Most casinos have stated that they will offer full pay and benefits for the full time of the shutdown.  All schools are already closed so at least it solves that issue.  All grocery stores and related establishments have been looted.  Good luck finding ammo and you can't buy a gun new because they can't get through to the feds for the background check.

Hey everyone! Thanks for all the concern and well wishes. The market is closed now so here's your update.

We didn't quite get low enough to hit my $500k goal so I'm still in the market. Based on multiple comments I did take some profits so I'm playing with free money now. People may be interested to know that you can't pull more than $50,000 a day out of Robinhood so most of my fire insurance money still on the platform in cash.

I also rolled out my options to reduce risk. Which is why this is flaired for Gain and not YOLO. 

Again thank you so much for your tendies wishes, concern, and camaraderie. I'll update again when I sell. It's been one hell of a ride this weekend so now I'm going to have a drink and get my first sleep in 3 days.

SPY,fh1ney,2020-03-11 19:18:28,Back with SPY predictions,"Disclaimer: I‚Äôm a degenerate who likes looking at graphs and has a gambling addiction (but made 50% return today)

Hi yet again my fellow autists, as you can tell, my guess turned out to be correct and the market opened red today. This reinforces the trend and I will buy either calls or puts on SPY based on it before the closure today again.

What happened yesterday: People were anticipating good news from Trump. Just like always he made himself an idiot (not surprising). Hence stonks went down.

This graph shows a reoccurring trend that basically happens every day for quite some time now. We can see that if the market closes with a 15 min green candle, it will open a lot lower the next day and vice versa.

This happens because we are in a very volatile market and people are scared to keep their stocks overnight. This means if the market is trending up at the end of the day people will be selling and if market is going down most see it as an opportunity. This results in the market going in the opposite direction on the next day opening.

Additionally, if we end up breaking the 273 resistance today and close with a green candle (15 min), the chance of it being bloody tomorrow is very fucking high.

Id like to address a couple of comments from yesterday:

For the retard who mentioned recency bias. The whole theory of trading is based on the idea that a trend is more likely to continue than stop. This is different from flipping a coin since the market fluctuations are caused my people's psychology, not mere chance.

Changed the graph to the dark mode.

Added new arrows which look better and coloured them with my crayons.

&#x200B;

TLDR for people with short attention span: If SPY is closing red, but calls. If SPY is closing green buy put.

EDIT: This depends on the volume at the end of the day. This trend might not work if the volume is low last 30 minutes.

EDIT 2: If we are closing with 3 green 15min candles and volume as high or higher as yesterday I'm spending all my miserable 900 on puts.

EDIT 3: If last candle green, outs. If red, better wait!

EDIT 4: these are confusing times, safer to wait until tomorrow

LAST EDIT: I was trying to buy puts since it was green at the time, but thanks to RH it's still pending. What I think will happen is the market will open slightly lower tomorrow since the closure was so uncertain today.",Technicals,0.94

Since H1N1 got memory holed and everybody forgot about it, the virus became a modern flu, we have flu shots for this thing and chances are you've probably had it at one point or another -- it's just one of the flues that floats around each season. But the Corona is different...

First off, this thing already has a reproduction rate higher than any of the previous outbreaks in the last 150 years [\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notable_flu_pandemics). AND it's one of the most deadly -- however only to certain age groups which is a big difference [\[4\]](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/). Now I do want to make it clear that the Spanish Flu was a lot deadlier to healthy adults, also the age demographics have changed. StatsCanada actually has a good tool that shows the population pyramid and you can compare Spanish Flu in 1918 to 2020 and it'll have some similar-ish results to the USA [\[5\]](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/pyramid/pyramid.cfm?type=1&geo1=01). There's also population pyramid tool here for the USA but it only goes back to 1950 [\[6\]](https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2020/).

Buddy of mine with access to a Bloomberg terminal sent this to me the other day which tracks the spread of the Corona virus [\[7\]](https://imgur.com/a/O4J6cuc). Think the code is 'Map Virus' or something. What matters is that we can see a very obvious trend of exponential growth, in fact that's how you model these things... This thing will spread like wildfire once it starts to hit the cities in America, and... already has. [All it takes is one 'chad spreader'](https://imgur.com/a/N542fqR) to jump on the subway and it'll be a matter of weeks and the entire city is infected. In fact it's already happened in Toronto so buy puts on $CANADA [\[8\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-toronto-man-diagnosed-with-covid-19-used-local-transit-for-three-days/).

What matters is that we can see that something like \~60.8 million people who got H1N1 in the USA from 2009 to 2010 and this thing had an r0 of only like \~1.5ish. The bat soup virus currently has an estimated r0 at \~2.4 right now, mind you this is a number that varies through time and can decrease by human intervention (such as quarantines of cities), which will inevitably transpire...

If we assume that this thing spreads with even some level of similarity to H1N1 in 2009, this is going to be a bloodbath for the boomers. First and foremost, this will spread at a much higher rate among boomers and those in old folks homes, we've got evidence of that already [\[9\]](https://www.fox19.com/2020/03/07/coronavirus-concerns-stalls-cruise-ship-off-california/).

But that's not all. Italy is fucked. They just announced a quarantine of 1/4 of their fucking population [\[10\]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-live-updates-third-death-in-australia-as-cases-reach-more-than-70). Take wild guess how that's going to fare for their economy. The FTSE MIB is down shy of 20% from it's highs as it stands right now and its only going to get worse [\[11\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/i945?countrycode=it). Given that the Italy  is basically a leading indicator of what's going to happen in the USA...  I fucking DARE YOU to buy spy calls.

So let's get to the nuts and bolts of this. Some autist named Dr. James Lawler stated that worst case scenario this thing could infect 96m in the USA and kill 480,000 people [\[12\]](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-dr-james-lawler-warning-us-hospitals-infection-a9385031.html). However, funny enough his estimates are based on a mortality rate of 0.5%. The current mortality rate is \~3.5% so, rather, we could be looking at up to 3,360,000 dying in the USA if the mortality rate is what it currently is.

However, we can math this based on the population pyramids I posted above. In the USA if we take the known mortality rates and population pyramid and transpose that on the worst case scenario, we're looking at shy 1.9m dead (mostly older people) given that 30% get the virus in the next year [\[13\]](https://imgur.com/a/vfOz0Nf). If this spreads at the same rate as H1N1, then we're looking at a total of \~60.8 million infected in a year's time. This corresponds to \~18.6% of the population getting it and would result in \~1.16m people dead [\[14\]](https://imgur.com/a/WUDaMza).

Now, I'm willing to bet that my boy Donnie isn't interested in losing a massive chunk of his voting block so I'm betting that we see quarantines very soon in the USA, entire cities shut down just like we've seen in China and just like we've seen in Italy and Iran. It's going to happen and when it does, the lemmings will be shocked. I mean, this shouldn't come as a surprise, there's already runs on toilet paper in Australia over this thing [\[15\]](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/australians-scrap-toilet-rolls-coronavirus-panic-buying-200308014116516.html).

Anyways, I think we'll get a cure eventually and that everybody reading this will be fine, in fact I'm not a doomer whatsoever. Society will continue on and SPY will eventually recover and I'll join bull gang again, but I'm sure Monday will be a bloodbath after Italy quarantined like 16 million people.

But back to my point, just think about what'll happen to SPY when a US city announces a quarantine. They're already preparing for it by declaring states of emergency now [\[16\]](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-202-declaring-disaster-emergency-state-new-york). The fear will be real and it already is...

**EDIT:** Figured I'd add a bit more on Canada as I don't think it's priced in up there quite yet. Again, I took some numbers from StatsCanada [\[17\]](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/91-520-x/2010001/t334-eng.htm) and plugged them in against current known mortality rates and we ended up with this [\[18\]](https://imgur.com/a/YBX7XFV). Estimated 234k dead which... is bad, but that's a flood of dead people in a short amount of time. Also I assume a 30% infection rate but I think this things going to have a much high infection rate because of the fact that we corral all our old into old folks homes... it just takes one sick caretaker and they've all got it and the worst part is that you can have it and spread it without even knowing [\[19\]](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission-chinese-woman-relatives-2020-2). So this basically becomes a catch-22. If elderly care takers don't show up to work because they're sick, elderly people die, if they do show up, there's a chance they're giving them COVID-19, it just takes one and they'll all catch it... real morbid stuff. Basically each old folks home is a tranche in a CDO for the few of you retards that know what I'm talking about...

So how do we profiteer from this? And what will inevitably transpire?

**EDIT 2:** [SPX e-minis currently trading at shy of -5%... we're hitting the circuit breakers tomorrow. Fed will drop rates again by end of week.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/es00)

**Conclusion:**

I know half of you retards skipped to here but kudos to the champions that read everything I wrote.

1. General stock market decline, puts on $SPY or high beta stocks if IV isn't too high
2. for my perma-bull frens, calls on funeral home and burial companies: $SCI, $CSV, $MATW, $PLC:CA, $DTY:UK, etc. **EDIT:** (as u/dollarsandcents101 pointed out be careful on funeral homes... could ban funerals if this thing really get's going)
3. Puts on old folks care homes because those are probably going to be vacant here very shortly and thus less cash flows to investors... stocks like: $WELL, $VTR $OHI, **EDIT:** $CSH.UN:CA (Canadian, option chain is a lot less liquid than USA so... be careful), SIA:CA (another one, already crashing, has options, less liquid though)
4. I'm still bearish airlines and travel... I mean go look at the chart of $AAL. After 9/11 that stock went from $40 a share to literally $2 a share... in 2003. The same thing happened during the GFC, stock again went from over $40 a share to a fucking penny stock -- traded at like $0.30 per share. Get ready for round 3... I look forward to buying calls on airlines after this is all over.
5. bearish any developing country/emerging market ETF's. They're going to get hit hard.
6. I don't know anything about medical or medical research stocks but calls and puts on companies researching corona virus cure. Again... correct me if I'm wrong but to my understanding it's zero-sum, the company that gets a solid cure makes bank and the rest are fucked but again idk this isn't my area whatsoever. Also looks like a lot of these stocks are rocketing and IV is massive so I'm sitting on the sidelines on this one

If you're from r/all wanting to get in on the tendies, I saved a special one just for you! Go all in on $LVS 80C 3/13 calls, trust me. Cannot go tits up.",DD,0.96
DD,ffd6cz,2020-03-08 15:24:14,OIL CRASH OF 2020 - DD,"Morning fellow autists, i would like to share a few of my thoughts about what going on in the oil market and how you can maybe, just maybe make a dollar (some of you may lose a dollar).

**The following news  released since Fridays OPEC failed meeting:**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/opec-meeting-coronavirus-weighs-on-oil-demand-as-oil-prices-fall.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/opec-meeting-coronavirus-weighs-on-oil-demand-as-oil-prices-fall.html)

&#x200B;

**Some key points from the article are as follows:**

\- OPEC and non-OPEC allies failed on Friday to agree on how much oil production to cut amid the coronavirus outbreak

\- Russia reportedly refusing to give the green light to the deepest supply cuts since the global financial crisis.

\- Russian Energy Minister¬†Alexander Novak told reporters leaving the meetings in Vienna on Friday that it meant that members could now pump what they liked starting April 1

\- ‚ÄúWe have no reason to doubt the continued commitment of the Russian Federation to this partnership,‚Äù OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo told reporters.  **(this we know can be taken with a grain of salt and a shot of tequila.)**

THEN! this happened:

Some points from the article:

\-Saudi Arabia kicked off an all-out oil war on Saturday slashing official pricing for its crude and making the deepest cuts in at least 20 years on its main grades, in a bid to push as many barrels into the market as possible

&#x200B;

\- The collapse of the meeting between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its erstwhile partners effectively ends the cooperation between the Saudis and Russia that has underpinned oil prices since 2016.

\- Unshackled from the cartel‚Äôs restrictions and with budget holes to fill, there is every chance producers will ramp up output.

\- Saudi Arabia pumped 9.7 million barrels a day last month, but with the agreement on output cuts expiring at the end of March, the kingdom will be free to produce as much as it wants. The Saudis say they can pump as much as 12.5 million barrels a day.

*- Aramco slashed its official selling price for flagship Arab Light crude to buyers in Asia by $6 a barrel, to a discount of $3.10 below the Middle East benchmark. The cuts eclipsed the $1.90 reduction expected by traders and refiners. It also reduced Medium crude to Asia by $6 a barrel, dropping the grade to a $4.05 discount, according to the company‚Äôs pricing sheet.* ***(VERY IMPORTANT)***

***Looking into the future:***

***We are about to enter an OIL glut:***

&#x200B;

As you can see on the monthly chart, oversold conditions haven't been encountered in over 5 years. Since our large sell off and we are approaching the $30/Barrel price. I expect the price to dip below 30 to $20-$25 before support can be found. (This is news dependent as things could change).

Our Next Support is $20 Dollars

Look for Puts in /CL Futures which provide a good cheap way to enter options contracts or any stocks ETF's ETNS or banks that are oil heavy in portfolio.

The coronavirus will shut down major cruise ships and airplane travel also pushing prices down.

RCL,fehkg7,2020-03-06 19:14:35,Gain: I accidently bought 100 RCL call options yesterday and sold for $2.7K gain today,"This is my first post on this subreddit. I never posted here because I thought I was a normie and didn't want to come off condescending to all you autists. Turns out I was one of you all along.

Yesterday I put in a buy order for 10 RCL call option for $910 before market close thinking this was a good time to start building a long position for the eventual bounce, and average down if the stock price kept going down. I quickly realized I put in a buy order for 100 options instead of 10 totaling $9,100! I was in PDT restriction so I could not sell.
I decided I was going to hold and pray for the stock price to bounce up the next day.
 
I woke up this morning and saw the stock price was down almost 5% and accepted my fate of sinking with the ship. My mistake resulted in a $2000 unrealized loss. Fortunately, a few minutes after market opened, RCL stock price jumped up from -5% to +3% where I was able to sell my position for a $2700 gain.

""Miss you bad"" - Talking about all the money he deposited and lost in his RH account. 

""Sorry I ain't called you back"" - Margin called...

""Hurt him bad"" - The government tortured him into not telling us about it

""People get divorced for that"" - Referring to Kim showing us her baboon butt

""Drop some stacks, pops is good"" - This is the cycle of the autist. He thinks if he can pour some more money in, the next contract has to make me rich

""Momma pass in Hollywood, if you ask, lost my soul"" - Kanye is clearly less coherent than we even predicted here 

""Driving fast, lost control"" - Kanye comes back to his senses here and is speaking in reference to $SPCE. $SPCE was mooning driving so fast to get there, then lost control and fucking landed in the gutters.

""Off the road, jaw was broke"" - Broken jaw helped with blowjobs to make up for the lost money in the market

SPY,fdmgrr,2020-03-05 01:08:20,$SPY 50% retrace,"I spent some time looking at lots of significant initial past drops in $SPY. Daily charts typically showed a 7 bar initial drop followed by a 2-3 bar retrace of 50%. If we take the initial $SPY of $338 with a drop to $285 this gives us a 53 point drop. A 50% retrace on that is 26 points. 285+26 =  311 which is where we are currently hovering. We dropped 7 bars red and now up 3 bars green. Historical charting would indicate a steep drop from here as the issues causing the initial drop have not been resolved (Virus getting worse, more bad news)

MOON,fcnw07,2020-03-03 03:45:43,"Market going back up to the MOON tomorrow, all your puts going to 0","On Thursday I called that Friday would be the bottom of the market, the SP500 would hit near 2850 and bounce back up. I was on WSB discord and EVERYONE was laughing at me when I said I was buying SPY calls. Well keep fucking laughing while your puts expire worthless tomorrow. Look at the charts and see for yourself.

(EDIT: Im calling for a big bounce this week, not a bull market to ATH. You gay bears can have the fun next week. At the end of this week we may still close flat or red).

Lets look at the 15 minute chart of the S&P500. Inverse head and shoulders pattern, stocks going up. Buy calls.

https://preview.redd.it/onvps9fgbdk41.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=2db767e064c84977fc8f5f484dbfc38a33a316b1

Now lets look at the daily chart below. The S&P 500 chart today easily broke above the 200 DMA, that is a good sign for the bulls. Next resistance ahead is the 3139 level which is the 9 DMA.

https://preview.redd.it/ryz6lgxxbdk41.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=529ff7f83174621a9c3b3cfcdbd97b82c788abe3

Lets look at the 60 minute chart (below). There is some resistance at the red line around the 3129 level. This is close to the 3139 level on the daily chart.

https://preview.redd.it/6x4fgshccdk41.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7891a4beb11a11d1c36bd8fb0f21ad652a878f1

Seems like tomorrow there will be a big resistance zone between the 3129-3139 level. If the S&P 500 can break above that level, then the next resistance is 3168 (100 DMA), but honestly I think itll just shoot right over it and go for 3263 level (50 DMA). Here is the reason why, look at this last chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/03bf0e6scdk41.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=391838680758d0d004219ef805de917d0a6be9b4

This chart shows the ratio of puts to calls in the market.

More than 1 means more people buying puts. Anything above 1.1 is getting too risky and 1-sided. Anything above 1.2 is extreme

Less than 1 means  more people buying calls. Anything below 0.8 is extreme.

Look at this fucking chart, people are STILL holding onto their puts that were bought last week. The ratio today closed at 1.29, which is at the same level that we had on Thursday and Friday.

**MOST PEOPLE HAVE NOT TAKEN PROFITS ON THEIR PUTS FROM LAST WEEK.**

Tomorrow the market will open higher and LOTS of people will be selling their puts to cut their losses, which will bring the market much higher. We will go way past the 100 DMA (3168 level), we just need to break above the strong 3129-3139 level, then we go to the moon.

TLDR: Everyone in this subreddit is fucking autistic and is still holding puts (thanks to Robinhood). Market opening higher tomorrow.

EDIT: My call option position [https://imgur.com/1NC0lRs](https://imgur.com/1NC0lRs)

EDIT 2: My previous post calling the bottom last week [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faloru/we\_are\_close\_to\_the\_bottom\_buy\_spy\_calls\_soon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faloru/we_are_close_to_the_bottom_buy_spy_calls_soon/)

EDIT 3: So many people pissed off and downvoting this to the ground. Shows how many people are still holding their puts and about to lose tons of money. Market definitely opening higher tomorrow. Also I forgot to mention the VIX closed back inside the bollinger bands today after being outside of them for 4 straight days, big buy signal.",Technicals,0.85

A,fc8cz0,2020-03-02 08:08:58,A Beautiful Monday,"The bull is excitedly awaiting the market open. He sits in front of his monitor, behind him, two super models from last night's threesome shift in their morning drowsiness. He readies to cash in his SPY calls, dreams of Lambos in his head. Futures were green the day before, victory was assured. The gay bears could say that futures didn't matter as much as they wanted, but the bull knew that futures were aptly named futures because they predicted stonks' future.

The clock strikes the fated time, pre-market is live. SPY 360 is a reality. Without wasting any time the bull unzips his pants to give room for his massive erect cock and proceeds to gloat on r/wallstreetbets. The bears had had it too good for too long, two weeks. It was time to resume with a glorious 5 year bull run. Absorbed in his ultra based shitpost against the gay bears the bull forgets to keep up with the  news, after all his victory was already guaranteed. He finally clicks the yellow POST button, anxious to tell every gay bear that he told them so, that stonks only go up, and that their dik smol. 

Unbeknownst to the bull the world did not stop for him to write his post. He is immediately met with taunts and insults from the gay bears that managed to get permission from their wives' boyfriends to use the computer. Among all the jeers and ridicules was one comment that made the bulls erect cock turn into floppy lump of flesh.

1) Stay up to date with all your shots, you're literally already autistic so it literally cannot go tits up.

2) Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

3) Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

4) Stay home when you are sick and cover your goddamn mouth if you got to sneeze or cough. 

5) Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

6) Routinely clean frequently touched surfaces and objects.

7) Buy puts.

Edit:
8) Don‚Äôt eat bat soup.

Title says it all, I realized I missed out on the power weaponized autism & meme stocks have on the markets. So when I first heard rumbles about SPCE I decided to jump in with calls - confident it would tank on earnings, which is why I then switched to puts near the top. My puts are still open, and they were worth a good amount more before Friday. We'll see how that plays out, I expect it to hit $10 in the next few weeks as the normies and boomers realize they've been memed.


I'm not positive but I'm pretty sure that if I had sold my $22 strike 2/21 calls on Feb 19 instead of Feb 14 they would have been worth ~$15k instead of the $2k I got (sold when share price was at $28, then it hit $37 the next week) But I'm not smarticle enough to understand IV crush.

A,fb69qv,2020-02-29 04:03:49,A quick thank you,"So I'm not exactly sure what brought me to WSB, probably some r/all post - needless to say I found it.

About a four months ago my mothers went through Cancer recurrence of something we thought had been gone for years now.

~~Needless to say,~~ I've been working a second job to help save up money and support her with some things back home - (I'm 34, no I don't still live with my mother).  ~~Needless to say~~ after finding this community last week, I pulled some money from my personal savings that I was using to put towards fixing up my basement a bit to try to invest and get some extra capital to help out back home. Worst case if I lost it all, it was for my basement, no big deal.

I watched probably 30 hours of video around options, read nearly every discussion on here, and observed the discord for a while. I started trading around the Ally / AMD spam, was up 2k on my way to work and down 1700 by the time i got there. Lesson learned.

I reached out to some of you for advice in the discord, was called a retard (thanks, I know it's a term of endearment) , and was given some really great advice and guidance. I asked probably 100 stupid questions, but was always given some really strong answers (and sarcastic abuse)

End of today I sold my last group of SPY puts (right before the stupid 2.5% upswing) . I ended up around +2000 total . Far from the likes of a lot of you, but 2000 more that will immensely help back home.

I just wanted to take a minute to say thank you to everyone here, even the psychopaths that sometimes blow my mind.

Not sure if I'll dive back in next week - I think Im just going to take the money and run and do what I can to continue helping out - but again, thank you, retards.

TQQQ,f8s1tc,2020-02-24 15:33:53,TQQQ is going BUST,"Alright autists, listen up. The retards who run $TQQQ are autists just like you, they over-leveraged themselves and are now going bust. Instead of holding cash closer to 15-20-25% of their nominal exposure, as they normally do, in the past years they started holding less and less, now around 9-10% of nominal exposure in cash, and another 23-33% in STONKS (because holding stonks instead of cash = more gainz, greedy asswipes). You can find their holdings on Friday after close [here](https://www.proshares.com/funds/tqqq_daily_holdings.html) if you want to confirm. 

That works until it doesn't, and today they are blowing themselves the fuck up. After Friday's close rebalancing, TQQQ held $12,520,585,402 worth of nominal exposure in NASDAQ 100 Index SWAPS (i.e. if NDX is up 1% on Monday, they get paid 1% of the $12.5b in cash at the end of the day, and if it's down 1% on Monday, they lose 1% of the $12.5b and have to pay up at the end of they day).

Their collateral is as follows: $1,327,634,666 CASH (around 10.6% of exposure) and $4,266,859,496 in STONKS at Friday closing prices (34% of exposure).


IF NDX closes down 5% today, they have to pony up around $625m cash. This will cut the total assets from $5.6b to $5b. But 77% of their collateral assets are in stocks, which are also down. So their actual asset value will be AT MOST ~$4.3b. That's actually a LOSS of ~25% for today, not 15%. But wait, there's more. TQQQ will need at least an extra $1b in CASH on top of their loss for today, to use as swap collateral in the rebalancing for tomorrow. That means TQQQ will have to DUMP STONKS OUT THE MF WAZOO, which will bring QQQ down even further, which will mean that TQQQ will close down even more than 15% etc => feedback loop => even worse loss => real trouble

IF NDX closes down more than 6-7%, it's a straight up BUST. 

Not only are they greedy fucks, they actually increased their share holdings to cash ratio since the 19th... That's right, TQQQ bought the dip and now are gettting EXTRA bearclapping. 


Plays are SELL ANY TQQQ shares you're long bros don't be retarded and risk holding the bag all the way to 0, short TQQQ and/or back up the truck and buy asstons of OTM puts.

TLDR: TQQQ got greedy, over-leveraged themselves, and now getting their ass MARGIN CALLED by the gay bear gang and have a good chance of going BUST.

TSLA,f848m3,2020-02-23 04:58:25,Lost 93k selling naked TSLA and SPCE calls - lessons learned and moving forward,"Inspired by /u/stormwillpass's post on writing naked TSLA calls, I wanted to share with the community a similar story, how not to have your money vanish before your eyes and what I've learned during this process.

Background: I trade with Fidelity and have Level 5 option power.

During the early days of February, I started writing naked $TSLA short term (3-4 days out) calls at about .15 Delta thinking that there was no way the stock would hit the strike and I would profit.

However, $TSLA spiked on multiple days, and the IV on my calls exploded (wrote them at 180% IV and BTC at 350+ IV) that caused my cash requirement to increase significantly and resulted in a margin call and subsequent forced liquidation (Buy to Close) at significant losses.

The shitty thing about this is that $TSLA closed the week below the strike price of my calls, and I would have gotten out with a profit if my broker didn't liquidate me.

This same exact thing happened with $SPCE with me writing $35C and $40C calls early this week, and was margin called and liquidated and the stock closed the week at $33.87.

Lessons learned:

* Writing naked calls on anything is a terrible fucking idea and if either the price of your security moves against you and/or IV explodes, you are at risk of being margin called. If that happens,  you literally have no choice but to liquidate and would not be able to bank on the security moving in your favor in the time remaining on your contracts.
* Fidelity is much more conservative with margin than almost any other broker I've used, (Charles Schwab, RH) and would margin call you even if you still have a significant amount of capital on your account. The day I was margin called, I still had 60k account value left. I also was not given any time to meet my margin call so it was wire in cash immediately or we will liquidate you.

Let me know if you have any questions about this. Hopefully, the goal is this post is to teach theta gang that you should always hedge your positions that have unlimited losses so you don't end up like me.

TL:DR - you can be absolutely correct and still lose money.

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger.

SPCE,f3vpqo,2020-02-14 18:43:26,SPCE is going down below $22 - get your Tendies now... I have a gut feeling,"Its either that shitty Chinese food I ate yesterday or a real gut feeling. I think this company in the LONG RUN... will be incredible but its getting too much hype off Instagram posts and moving a space ship. They haven't done ANYTHING YET and yet their Market cap is 5.3 BILLION!!??!?

I have never been a Bear and I know STONKS only GO UP.... and this will only go up in the future, but this parabolic rise in the past 10 days... isn't sustainable. Cheap   3/6 $21 Puts 1.4

I bet you u/WSBGGOD would agree!!  Let the downvotes start coming just because SPCE is going to the Moon.

MSFT,f3taxf,2020-02-14 15:57:41,You fuckers fucked me over with $MSFT,I‚Äôve been sitting on September 210c MSFT calls since early January and all of a sudden the stock starts dipping as soon as this place starts buying. Luckily the attention spans here are shorter than Bezos‚Äô cock so we‚Äôll start rolling again in the near future. But I‚Äôm happy that all of you who bought weekly calls got fucked.,Discussion,0.81
SPCE,f3t4si,2020-02-14 15:44:34,SPCE to 26 today.,"Today is the day it hits 25, a major milestone to 100 then it will continue to 26. Its not too late, from 24-100 there are lots of tendies along the way. 

Buy SPCE, don‚Äôt be a üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª

Edit: Snooze you lose....

Edit 2: I called that shit, gay bears may leave now

Edit 3: Don‚Äôt freak out about price rn, it looks like a dip but there are only like 2k shares being sold as quick profit until 26.3

Edit 4: If you sell rn I‚Äôm gonna find you and kill you, stop wasting profits

Edit 5: Use the dip to buy when it hits its lowest. Good chance to get in on this shit. I‚Äôm up 300% in the last 2 weeks lol

Hold boys, 27 is an easy one per sales volume.


Edit 6: THE AMOUNT OF SHARES BLOCKING 30$ IS VERY LITTLE. 

Edit 7: that just changes very quickly now a decent barrier in 28. Fukkkk

Edit 8: Imo it‚Äôs gonna spike right now at 12:40 and then crash until 2 then recover back to where we are now setting us up for Tuesday 20% gains.

Edit 9: I think I was right üìâ for a little bit I think boys. Don‚Äôt be üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª tho and buy puts lol

Final Edit: Good day ladies and gents and retards. Was a great day for SPCE. Happy tendies and remember not to be a pussy. Now go jerk off to SPCE charts bc you don‚Äôt have a girl to fuck tonight. ‚ù§Ô∏è

MSFT,f3fzoh,2020-02-13 21:09:00,Here's the truth about $MSFT,"If you have anything less than a March call, you're probably fucked. I wish it weren't true but Bezos can't just be happy with his $165 million mansion and is upset at the term ""Microsoft"" because it reminds him of his penis.

That being said, this will start to rebound in a week and then go back to normal uptrend in two weeks. 

So, yes, buy this dip but don't get emotional. If you're down, you're down. It sucks but that's the way the game goes. Just time this dip and make your money back. Put the losses in the back of your head and treat it as a completely new opportunity.

For those that have April or father out calls, you're fine and you'll get your tendies in due time.",Discussion,0.97
MSFT,f3flkd,2020-02-13 20:44:03,$MSFT and the Great Reckoning (DD inside),"Sad about lost tendies and seeing red? Your 3/20 $200 calls are losing you money? Here‚Äôs some great advice for you my fellow autists. Double the fuck down baby. Ask yourself, when has Microsoft ever not risen to a new high after a dip? Never. What has Papa Trump been doing his entire presidency? Packing the courts with his judges and throwing legal precedents out the window. If you consider the extrapolated mathematics and we use the formula of X + Y = T, where X is Microsoft and Y is the courts and T is of course, tendies, you will find that after doing the math, this only means one thing. Trump will ensure Microsoft gets the contract, Microsoft will boom even bigger than before, and tendies will rain from the sky in glorious rapture. The false Amazon prophets will try and lead us astray in these three days the contract is delayed, and all we have to do is double down on our positions and buy even more calls on the dip. Literally fool proof, cannot go tits up. Thank you for coming to my TED talk",Shitpost,0.95

If all goes accordingly, headlines will read AWS defeated by Azure. Refocusing attention on Microsoft's profitable and growing cloud business. Not to mention, this is a 10 year deal with openings to new government cloud deals.

***Why is this a big deal?***

From my personal experience in the cloud business, I've worked directly with one of Amazon's subsidiaries on large cloud deals (over 7-figures) in Asia & South America for streaming services that needed low-latency that AWS could not provide due to their datacenter locations. It took our company over 7 months through litigation, red-lines, etc to finalize a contract. One the contract was finished and approved, getting new business can be done in the same day, i.e., once Microsoft is awarded, they can continue growing their government deals as needed, in the same day.

Thus, tomorrow's ruling is a big win (if it happens) for Microsoft.

Update: [the author just posted a new article](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/02/as-key-jedi-court-decision-looms-pentagon-warns-of-national-security-concerns/)

A few key takeaways:

1. ""...the government argued not only that Amazon lacks the necessarily legal basis to get the temporary stop-work order, issuing one would cause **concrete harm to national security**.""

*Favors MSFT*

2) ""...To win the injunction, among other factors, Amazon needs to show that it‚Äôs likely to win the underlying lawsuit and that it its interests would suffer more without a work stoppage than the government‚Äôs would if the JEDI buildout was paused.""

*Favors MSFT*

3) ‚ÄúWhile still lacking several key features of the JEDI Cloud‚Ä¶\[DoD\] anticipates a¬† financial¬† harm of between $5 and $7 million dollars every month that performance of the JEDI contract is delayed.‚Äù

*Nail in the coffin. Case dismissed. MSFT, flawless victory.*
