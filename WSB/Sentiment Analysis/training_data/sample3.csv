I have been a member of WSB for awhile and have played around with small amounts of money, losing some by joining the msft 3/20 gang and tanker gang. Around november I saw some GME DD's and did my own research too. After doing so I deposited all my savings (1000$) into GME.

The recent rise has allowed me to help out my family a bit financially, doing a few nice things recently like taking them out to dinner or helping with gifts

DD,l6novm,2021-01-28 05:14:36,"The real DD on SLV, the worlds biggest short squeeze is possible and we can make history","Update 2/19: finally managed to get an update post through moderation- much better than this original! [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnzeho/the\_silver\_short\_squeeze\_is\_glaringly\_obvious\_to/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnzeho/the_silver_short_squeeze_is_glaringly_obvious_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

Update 2/4 - someone went ahead and spelled out the mechanics of the squeeze quite well and I would like to give their post attention [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc8vgo/slv\_is\_not\_going\_to\_get\_squeezedslv\_is\_the\_trojan/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc8vgo/slv_is_not_going_to_get_squeezedslv_is_the_trojan/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \- however, they are betting on SLV which is controversial. If SLV does have the silver they say they do it’s a great bet. If not, then PSLV is the way to go. I have switched to PSLV

Update 2/2 - I am able to comment again. I messaged several mods on Reddit and the mod account on Twitter. None of them responded but it appears I am able to comment again so I assume one of them lifted my ban

Update 2/1 - I have been banned from posting on WSB. I guess they aren’t yet deleting my post here given the media attention. If this was a rogue mod I’d appreciate being restored the ability to post on WSB.  I’m open to talking to any mods

Update 1/31 - there have been tons of 'what to buy' questions so [I added a clarity post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9tzkv/the_dd_on_slv_updated_131_clarity_on_what_to_buy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), hope it helps.  It's also getting downvoted to hell because its not about GME so that's discouraging.  The speed at which the downvotes flew in makes me think someone made bots to crush new posts related to SLV (or maybe anything not GME).  It makes no sense for this post to have 93% upvotes and my new one to have 28%.

I have not sold my GME to buy SLV.  I had a small pre-existing position in leaps I bought months ago.

Created an [official Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20) not sure if I’ll use it, but didn’t want anyone to impersonate me on there

Here is the longer DD for the short squeeze case for SLV, a follow-up from my shorter post a few hours ago. Note that I talk in first person as this is something I’m going to do. Everyone is free to do as they individually please and copy my trade if they’d like to.  I think it’s absurd that forces at be think this forum is manipulating by posting publicly but that’s where we are at right now.

First things first, **I'm not doing this until the GME rise is done.** I am long GME but am going long SLV immediately after.

Update 1/29: due to the manipulation and collusion of citadel, hedge funds, and brokers to change the rules and rig the game in their favor. Who likely knew ahead of time and bought puts right before and calls at the bottom, GME is too important to abandon still. SLV is still my next play but GME needs to go to $1000 and these people need to go to jail.

**If you just want to know what to buy skip to the end**

I present 2 investment DDs in this post, the short squeeze and the fundamentals.  If you want to see what to buy

**The short squeeze:**

Buy SLV shares and SLV call options to force physical delivery of silver to the SLV vaults. Also buy physical silver bullion.  The best possible thing would be to take physical delivery in the futures market if you have access to do so.

The silver futures market has oscillated between having roughly 100-1 and 500-1 ratio of paper traded silver to physical silver, but lets call it 250-1 for now.  This means that for every  250 ounces in open interest in the futures market, only 1 actually gets delivered.  Most traders would rather settle with cash rather than take delivery of thousands of ounces of silver and have to figure out to store and transport it in the future.

The people naked shorting silver via the futures markets are a couple of large banks and making them pay dearly for their over leveraged naked shorts would be incredible.  It's not Melvin capital on the other side of this trade, its JP Morgan.  Time to get some payback for the bailouts and manipulation they've done for decades (look up silver manipulation fines that JPM has paid over the years).

The way the squeeze could occur is by forcing a much higher percentage of the futures contracts to actually deliver physical silver.  There is very little silver in the COMEX vaults or available to actually be use to deliver, and if they have to start buying en masse on the open market they will drive the price massively higher.  There is no way to magically create more physical silver in the world that is ready to be delivered.  With a stock you can eventually just issue more shares if the price rises too much, but this simply isn't the case here.  The futures market is kind of the wild west of the financial world.  Real commodities are being traded, and if you are short, you literally have to deliver thousands of ounces of silver per contract if the holder on the other side demands it.  If you remember oil going negative back in May, that was possible because futures are allowed to trade to their true value.  They aren't halted and that's what will make this so fun when the true squeeze happens.

Edit for more detail:  let’s say there’s one futures seller who gets unlucky and gets the buyer who actually wants to take delivery. He doesn’t have the silver and realizes it’s all of a sudden damn difficult to find some physical silver.  He throws up his hands and just goes long a matching number of futures contracts and will demand actual delivery on those. Problem solved because he has now matched the demanding buyer with a new seller.  The issue is that the new seller has the same issue and does the exact same thing.  This is how the cascade effect of a meltup occurs.  All the naked shorts trying to offload their position to someone who actually has some silver. My goal is to ensure that I have the silver and won’t sell to them until silver is at a far higher price due to the desperation.

The silver market is much larger than GME in terms of notional value, but there is very little physical silver actually readily available (think about the difference between total shares and the shares in the active float for a stock), and the paper silver trading hands in the futures market is hundreds of times larger than what is available.  Thus when they are forced to actually deliver physical silver it will create a massive short squeeze where an absurd amount of silver will be sought after (to fulfill their contractually obligated delivery) with very little available to actually buy.  They are naked shorting silver and will have to cover all at once and the float as a percentage of the total silver stock globally is truly miniscule.

**The fundamentals:**

The current gold to silver ratio is 73-1.  Meaning the price of gold per ounce is 73 times the price of silver.  Naturally occurring silver is only 18.75 times as common as gold, so this ratio of 73-1 is quite high.  Until the early 20th century, silver prices were pegged at a 15-1 ratio to gold in the US because this ratio was relatively known even then.  In terms of current production, the ratio is even lower at 8-1.  Meaning the world is only producing 8 ounces of silver for each newly produced ounce of gold.

Global industry has been able to get away with producing so little new silver for so long because governments have dumped silver on the market for 80 years, but now their silver vaults are empty.  At the end of WW2 government vaults globally contained 10 billion ounces of silver, but as we moved to fiat currency and away from precious metal backed currencies, the amount held by governments has decreased to only 0.24 billion ounces as they dumped their supply into the market. But this dumping is done now as their remaining supply is basically nil.

This 0.24 billion ounces represents only  8% of the total supply of only 3 billion ounces stored as investment globally.  This means that 92% of that gold is held privately by institutions and by millions of boomer gold and silver bugs who have been sitting on meager gains for decades.  These boomers aren't going to sell no matter what because they see their silver cache as part of their doomsday prepper supplies.  It's locked away in bunkers they built 500 miles from their house. Also, with silver at $23 an ounce currently, this means all of the worlds investment grade silver only has a total market cap of $70 billion.  For comparison the investment grade gold in the world is worth roughly $6 trillion. This is because most of the silver produced each year actually gets used, as I have mentioned.  $70 billion sounds like a lot, but we don’t have to buy all that much for the price to go up a lot.

\*\*If the squeeze happens, it would be like 40 years worth of their gains in 4 months \*\*

The reason that only 8 ounces of silver are produced for every 1 ounce of gold in today's world is because there aren't really any good naturally occurring silver deposits left in the world.  Silver is more common than gold in the earth's crust, but it is spread very thin.  Thus nearly every ounce of silver produces is actually a byproduct of mining for other metals such as gold or copper.  This means that even as the silver price skyrockets, it wont be easy to increase the supply of silver being produced.  Even if new mines were to be constructed, it could take years to come online.

Finally, most of this newly created silver supply each year is used for productive purposes rather than kept for investment.  It is used in electronics, solar panels, and jewelry for the most part. This demand wont go away if the silver price rises, so the short sellers will be trying to get their hands on a very small slice of newly minted silver.  The solar market is also growing quickly and political pressure to increase solar and electric vehicles could provide more industrial demand.

The other part of the story is the faster moving piece and that is the inflation and currency debasement fear portion.  The government and the fed are printing money like crazy debasing the value of the dollar, so investors look for real assets like precious metals to hide out in, driving demand for silver.  The $1.9 trillion stimulus passing in a month or two could be a good catalyst.  All this money combined with the reopening of the economy could cause some solid inflation to occur, and once inflation starts it often feeds on itself.

&#x200B;

**What to buy:**

Edit 2/24: I now advocate buying PSLV for shares, physical metal if the premiums come back down, and if you want options then SLV is still ok for that.

I will be putting **50% directly into SLV shares, and 50% into the $35 strike SLV calls expiring 4/16**.  This way the SLV purchase creates a groundswell into silver immediately that then rockets through a gamma squeeze as SLV approaches $35.  Price target of $75 for SLV by end of April if the short squeeze happens.

Edit: for the part of your purchases going into shares, some people recommend PSLV because they think SLV might start lying about having the silver in their vault. Or that the custodian will be double counting, ie claiming that the same silver belongs to multiple people (banking on the fact that people wont all try to get their silver at once).  So if you buy SLV shares and calls, that's great.  But I think it could be prudent for us to buy options in SLV (no options on PSLV) and shares in PSLV.  It all depends on how paranoid you want to be.  There is a lot of paranoia in the precious metals world.

Alternate options:

\- buying physical silver; this also works but you pay a premium to buy and sell so its less efficient and you take fewer silver ounces off of the market because of the premium you pay

\- going long futures for February or March; if you are a rich bastard and can actually take physical delivery of 1000s of ounces of silver by all means do so.  But if you simply settle for cash you are actually part of the problem.  We need actual physical delivery, which is what SLV demands and is why SLV is the way to go unless you are going to take delivery

\- miners; I don’t recommend buying miners as part of this trade.  Miners will absolutely go up if SLV goes up, but buying them doesn't create the squeeze in the actual silver market.  Furthermore, most silver miners only derive 30-50% of their revenue from silver anyways, so eventually SLV will outperform them as it gets high enough (and each marginal SLV dollar only increases miner profits by a smaller and smaller percentage)

**Details on SLV physical settlement:**

When SLV issues shares, the custodian is forced to true up their vaults with the proportional amount of silver daily.  From the SLV prospectus:

""An investment in Shares is:  Backed by silver held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.  The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust. The Trustee’s arrangements with the Custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no more than 1,100 ounces of silver in an unallocated form. The bulk of the Trust’s silver holdings is represented by physical silver, identified on the Custodian’s or, if applicable, sub-custodian's, books in allocated and unallocated accounts on behalf of the Trust and is held by the Custodian in London, New York and other locations that may be authorized in the future.""

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

Why do you keep doubling down on your short positions? Why are new hedge funds are coming in and scooping up new short positions? What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you understand who we are?

We don’t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don’t give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don’t fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children’s college funds away just to post memes about it.

Your plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven’t owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.

Double down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face.

Been seeing lots of degens writing small DD pieces of bullish or bearish shit. Y'all need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.

this is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by SEC somehow.

im also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates. Im not fucking liable lmao but i am balls deep 125 shares @ 19 average now, its literally all I have on this earth.

TLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin wont affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **🐻 🌈s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**

Compulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Basically been seeing posts about ""blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah"". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something

# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.

So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit , so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing binary fission on agar jelly 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having ""Digital game exchanging"" or something, image below.

[Online trade ins. It says online.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/2ba9j5d2zvb61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6f3f26c3588fdb8cc779aee8a3b1ce42859f33)

He also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\_dd\_buildapc\_kiosks\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)

BUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?

**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**

The expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.

In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.

We are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.

Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.

GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying ""omnichannel"" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.

Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.

Holdiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency.

[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:

>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.

Maniacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.

So in the heading i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.

&#x200B;

[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \(another reason shorts are fuk\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)

>The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)

This alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:

9.8/2.48 = \~3.95   3.95 \* $35.5 = \~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better.

from [statista](https://statista.com) :

>Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.

If we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \* 1.0224\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!

I really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout ""DigITaL"" or ""BlOCKbuSTER"" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those guys special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10.

**Bears are betting against:**

Ryan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion

Michael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april

u/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale

Reggie Fils-Aimé, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo

Senvest, a mega fund thats actively managed

Norweigan sovereign wealth fund

Fidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit

All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears

Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.

&#x200B;

Some valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----> Ryan Cohen dies.

# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.

Ok everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.

Although I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.

This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.

**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**

*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.

*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**

Short shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**

Short shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million

% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020

% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.

Some [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.

The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could buy 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.

Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.

[This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated](https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84)

Need rockets 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀:

Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts ""blockbuster"" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?

Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021:

[This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th](https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e)

So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \~21 to \~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.

These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.

SHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20.

Cost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.

Longs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to 💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/).

**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**

You realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.

**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**

**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**

&#x200B;

[This shows the suspected melvin puts \(51000 contracts, 5 Million shares, rolled up from july, strike price $24\) and lots of big ITM calls.](https://preview.redd.it/t8odq9btgwb61.jpg?width=821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61bb8a66e0ed83f0315921c295d1851a3c20c6c0)

[This shows the big put contract didnt get rolled over and the big ITM calls got exercised on friday. Large puts are underwater big timem while calls are in the big tendy zone.](https://preview.redd.it/3nqb33f0hwb61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dc83f542dcc3565ae0424121146101b73cf0083)

These two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.

Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.

Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.

**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**

Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.

Kodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**

Volkswagen went from **\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**

Overstock went from **\~$21 to $123**

Blue apron went from **$2.31 to $18**

Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.

$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \* 1.0281\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. 🌑 .

This shit can happen. Hold on.

**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**

&#x200B;

[This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u\/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman](https://preview.redd.it/4ysv7bzclwb61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=27ac6ac58b6366f81b53fa75966733b8a8d61d3c)

Basically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price.

This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.

Now we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.

**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**

IHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD

Ihor I quote:

>**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**

Ihor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down ""Short squeeze has happend"" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.

The bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.

Edit: **You fucking degens just enlightened me that cramer pump is real, funds are ruminating over the long weekend, and stmmy bills pumps stonks and that stimmy bill buys many an xbox. See you at andromeda! Also more rockets.**

Ratings are reviewed every quarter, and a review might be due this month (i.e. this coming week or next). Good chance that the agencies might upgrade GME to a B2/B, or even better to the next higher band (Ba/BB).

This guy is going to be seeing a lot more media attention the next few months and guess what he’s gonna be talking about. Blackberry fucking IVY and all the partnerships AWS has lined up. 

He’s proud of the partnership between Amazon Web Services and Blackberry.

GME,l7z0u9,2021-01-29 18:50:31,The GME shorts' endgame. INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.,"*READ*

Credit to [u/Pcbuildingnoob699](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pcbuildingnoob699/) \-- I'm rephrasing so it's just pure information/education and not financial advice.THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, THIS IS PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

When might you want to sell? A quick guide for GME noobs.TL;DR: DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌

&#x200B;

Too much disinformation about when to sell. We are seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (WHICH IS ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT IN YOUR FINANCIAL INTEREST) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how some smart investors will play the ending. \[Note: I u/TheKageyOne, will not be selling at all, at least not for a long time. I'm in this to hurt the shorts, send a message, and watch GME grow and restructure into a totally new e-commerce and brick and mortar business in the coming years).

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

* imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
* Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to **START** covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's **NOT** gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If people hold GME stocks play it right and hold while shorts cover, they can literally squeeze this to infinity as the shorts try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND DO WITH THIS INFORMATION WHAT YOU WILL. A LOT OF YOU ARE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

&#x200B;

Edit: Yes, I realize the days to cover reported in those links is actually lower now. I don't know enough to tell you what is accurate. I do know enough to tell you that if an investor buys and holds a share, there are fewer shares available for the shorts to cover with, so holding drives up the Days to Cover. If YOU are holding shares, YOU are controlling the Days to Cover. That is why so many people are advocating for 💎🙌",DD,0.98

&#x200B;

In my opinion, $BB got wrapped up in this $BANG phenomenon and is being attached to avoid any further losses by Big Money. There is so much good going for this company right now and $BB discussion has been relatively quiet. This dip is an absolute discount fire sale right now and although I am not a financial adviser and do not offer this as advice I am definitely thrilled about the buying opportunity and will definitely be capitalizing on it. Although I have been a member here for a short period and only trading for a few years now, I like to think I know a solid value play, especially in tech thanks to you smooth brains, when I see one. 1 - 3 years and this stock will make the difference between retiring comfortably on time and retiring early with excess spending money.

BB,l5cqey,2021-01-26 13:09:19,$BB long boi,"

Position:194 shares at $19.28


Disclaimer: I started trading this January and my views are purely informational and I do not condone anyone making financial/trading decisions based on this post. Don’t be a retard and do your DD before you trade. This is a bullish take on BB and may have some holes in it.



So I have been watching BB for a while now and feel the company is undervalued. Forgive me as I have not made a DD post before, I failed English in high school, and I am typing this up on my phone.


BB originally caught my attention because it struck me that it survived being primarily a phone company and shifted its business to its cyber security and other software. I Put it on my watch list to swing it a little bit and recently sold 140 shares at $11.


Seeing the price go up and the volume I decided I would jump back in since the trend analysis looked pretty good. Bought in at 19.28 and it almost immediately crashed, I suspect likely due to the pullback the whole market had this morning with stimulus talks being delayed and people taking profits.


Canada Halts trading today due to the volatility followed by BB making a statement in response basically saying idk why investors are buying up the stock we haven’t made any announcements 
Trading resumes and the price rises back up beyond open in AH, closing at nearly 20 dollars.

THEN as you have already probably seen, BB announces partnership with Baidu - coincidence? Probably not, investors probably coaxed that information out of them and they likely didn’t want to get caught in some insider trading schenangians. 

Speculation for tomorrow: BB Will open strong and meet or exceed the 40% growth of today since it just got that huge news. Baidu is Chinese google, and they partnered with BB since they need a operating system platform to mass produce their maps software in autonomous/ev vehicles with their partner GAC. Now this is a lot of China talk but BB is headquartered in CANADA which is much friendlier in regards to trade than the U.S.


A little bit of information about GAC, they are a Chinese automotive giant that has came to the United States National Automobile Dealers association expos begging for investors, however has not had much success since the last 4 years have not been good for U.S. and China Trade.


The LONG game: Once our new administration warms up to China after those in charge of trade take their cuts, (and they will because history repeats itself, but right now the bear case would be that Biden is not looking to change tariffs on China, playing tough until he gets some leverage is what I think is really going on) GAC will have lots of opportunity to start putting their vehicles on our roads. 
GAC is the highest rated car brand in China so it may have a chance in the United States if it plays its cards right, which means we could have Blackberry powered Autonomous EVs on our streets in the next 5 years. That in conjunction with Amazon partnership in their future autonomous ev ventures means this company is making a major comeback and is aligned with the right companies to potentially be a major player.

This company has a lot of value in our up and coming future of Electric and Autonomous vehicles.

I am too new to this to speculate on where this stock should be valued at, but here are some resources where I got my information so you can decide for yourself:

GME,l6os3d,2021-01-28 06:14:28,The $GME Short Thesis and how it could backfire if retail investors behave rationally,"So I'm seeing a lot of information out here about Melvin and 6 days to cover and all that and I think a lot of it is outdated. Actually, I know it's outdated because people were saying the same thing a week ago and $GME has risen like 300% since then. There's been a huge amount of price action, and yet the shorts everyone has been talking about have exited their positions and there's still tons of short interest. What gives? Why haven't the shorts learned their lesson? Are they just stupid? Maybe. But maybe not... Let's consider the short's view on this situation:

**The $GME Short Thesis as of 1/27:** Here's the scene. A stock which is widely regarded as colossally overvalued has doubled in value several times within a matter of weeks. You know that the retail investor plan is to force shorts into a squeeze scenario. However, volume is up to unprecedented levels as new traders flood into the market to get in on the action, so the days to cover is falling, making it easier for shorts to get out quickly when they get a window. Meanwhile, older long retail investors (aka bought like a day ago) are staring at what are, to them, very nice gains. It's been several days of insane price action already, and people are predicting the end is near because, well, it must be, right? The uncertainty and perceived risk of losing unrealized profits are very high.

You look at this and predict the following: **retail investors who have made tidy profits will sell upon a volatility move, causing a chain reaction of sell-offs**. In other words, you expect that the bubble is gonna pop upon sharp price action (could be either way) and then there's going to be a sharp decline as retail investors scramble to take whatever profits they can before the next guy sells at a higher price. 

So what do you do as a short with that thesis? Short the stock, of course! **Even if there's tremendous upwards price action the next day, you can just sell short again, pay off the old loan with the new short money, and now you're in an even better position.** Your best bet as a short is to short the stock the moment before the bubble pops. High interest rates from your lender don't bother you because, based on the thesis, you're only holding your loan for a few days and the share price on the other side is going to be way below where you shorted. This is why short interest is still strong - it's generally a good play to short a bubble that you expect to pop soon.

**How the Short Thesis could fall apart:** So, the whole short thesis is based upon the idea that retail investors are going to close out their $GME positions very abruptly as soon as they see some nice gains and sense that ""the end is near."" But here's the thing: what if they don't? As an investor in $GME myself, I did the following with my gains - I sold a portion of them to cover my initial cost basis and now I'm just sitting on the rest as ""house money."" I'm not buying in anymore because I'm managing risk, but I'm not pulling out because I think there's more juice to squeeze and I've got a lot of cushioning below if the price does start dropping. If this strategy is broadly applied by other retail investors (and it's a pretty classic and intuitive investing/gambling strategy), volume will slow down and the price will generally plateau. 

So as a short, aren't you happy that the price stopped rising? HELL NO. You need that price to either fall so you can close at a profit or rise sharply so you can roll your position up. $GME remaining tremendously overvalued at a steady price for a long time would be horrible for you as a short. You've taken out a huge loan, you're paying huge interest, and there seems to be no end in sight. This is how shorts playing volatility are forced to close at big losses - when the interest over time eats up all of their potential profits before volatility strikes. I think this is the scenario in which we'd see a true MOASS.

**Disclaimer: I am just a guy on the internet. I don't have specialized education in the market, but I think this is a pretty plausible thesis for the continued short interest and how the MOASS might develop. I could be totally wrong! Let me know what you think about it in the comments**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! Let’s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles & PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.

The company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.

So, guys, let’s go a little through the 4th quarter & yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.

The [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing & Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn’t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can’t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.

Both of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing & graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.🚀🚀

[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn’t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation & amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. 

They have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest & tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.

The company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 & Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.🚀🚀

Their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel’s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.🚀

[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world’s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.

They have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings & Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.

AMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future🚀

The one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9) 🚀, which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it’s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.

AMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

So, let’s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.🚀🚀🚀

I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation & Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. 

For the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.

So, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. 

If we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.

And now let’s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.🚀🚀🚀

For my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing & Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.

I think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage & digital currency mining.

For their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing & Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.

This means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest & other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. 

I [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.

So, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.

I like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   🚀🚀🚀

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets🚀🚀🚀 

I think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. 

So [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

I think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more & more chips that also keep advancing in technology. 

The company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.

And let’s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it’s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years & a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. 

AMD hasn’t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it’s a psychological resistance rather.

And let’s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it’s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.

So, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.🚀🚀🚀

One last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard & Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.

So, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel’s performance.

His girlfriend was deeply asleep next to him. She had come home late again last night after hanging out with Jake, the guy she jokingly called her boyfriend.

When GME goes to the moon and I get my tendies, she’s going to love me again!

His phone vibrated loudly on the nightstand next to him.
“I’m outside,” the text preview said. Fuck!

His brother, Charles, was outside. He had completely forgotten about the family brunch - a long-standing tradition that was usually a monthly occurrence. The pandemic had pushed their brunch plans and it had now been six months since their last reunion.

He clumsily climbed out of bed. He found his jeans from last night on the floor and jumped into them. They were the only jeans that still fit him. The lightly colored denim was starting to fade. He picked a black tee shirt that was loose enough to hide his pandemic gut. It had deodorant stains, so he knew his arms would be glued his sides all day.

He watered his thinning hair. He sprinted back into the bedroom.

“Bye, baby! I’ll see you after my family brunch.""
He leaned in to kiss her cheek but she, annoyed, dug her head deeper into the pillow so that she could keep sleeping.
He gulped at the purple bruise with teeth marks on the side of her neck.

The black Model S was sparkling in the sun. Their father bought it for Charles as a reward for getting accepted into the same neurosurgery fellowship their father trained at.
“That’s what you’re wearing?” Charles laughed.
“Ha ha yeah my other clothes are in the wash.”

His brothers biceps were bulging through the expensive shirt he was wearing. A water bottle condensed onto the cup holders. Charles was the family prodigy and exuded confidence in every step.

The drive to their parents house consisted of shallow catch-up small talk. He kept his hands on his laps the entire time in order to hide the Dorito stains on them.

                          -----   

“What the fuck do you mean you’re out of money, Dale?!” His father bellowed.
Images of $5,000 of expired PLTR YOLO calls came to mind.
If I had picked the expiration date for two weeks later, I’d be rich right now...
The other $5,000 his father gave him went into GameStop stock. He bought at the top, which was $350 dollars per share. It was now sitting at $80 per share.

They said I’d make tendies! They said it was free fucking money. There’s no way it could’ve gone tits up. Diamond hands prevai-

“Did you spend it all on the fucking stock market again?”
There’s no way out. I’m fucked. I don’t have any money. I need to tell him.

“Yes.”
“WHAT THE FUCK! You fucking degenerate!”
Charles was snickering next to him with his cell phone aimed at Dale. He was recording him. Susan, their sister, was blushing and looking at her phone. Their mother was embarrassed and looked worried.

Don’t give Charles a satisfying reaction. Stay cool. Diamond hands, baby.

""Dad. It's different this time! The shorts are ladder trading right now which is artificially bringing the price down. Plus, the short squeeze is coming any day now!""

He had no idea what ladder trading was. A user named u/PM_Me_Vagina_pics wrote that in a thread he saw earlier. Dale didn't even understand what a short squeeze was or how it worked. He barely grasped what puts and calls were and that's because Robinhood made it easy to do.

""You think you can beat billionaires at their own game?"" his dad hissed through clenched teeth. His jugular vein was bulging. Or was that his carotid vein?
I'll ask Charles later! He'll know.

""Yes! If we all hold on to our stock there is no way tha-""

“FUCK!”
His dad pounded his fists and left the table.

It wasn't even 11 AM and Dale had already ruined the day. Mother was mortified. Susan was scarlet. And Charles was chortling.

Most men would fold under the deep shame of being called a degenerate by their father. But Dale was not like most men. He took a bite of his blueberry waffles and pretended they were chicken tenders.
Yummy!

A small fire was alive inside of Dale. The spark of that flame came from a meme that made him giggle earlier. In the meme, there was a picture of a chimp. Or perhaps it was an ape? It was the caption, however, that captivated Dale and gave him the confidence to buy 500 more dollars worth of Gamestop stock. The caption read:

FOMO,lb6n2f,2021-02-02 22:16:21,How To Avoid A FOMO Buy In 10 Steps,"This checklist might save your day or at least save you some dollars. 

You might think that you would never FOMO into a stock or you might be wondering if this applies to you. Ask yourself these questions to find out if you need the checklist. 

- Have you ever thought of buying some super hyped shares at ATH?

- Have you thought about joining ‘the team’ in the squeeze on stockthatshallnotbenamed? (Ps. there are no teams in retail investing it’s every man for himself)

- Do you use WallStreetBets? 

If you answered yes to any of the precursor questions below then you are in danger of a FOMO trade and need this checklist. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW NOT TO FOMO CHECKLIST 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask yourself why you want to buy the stock. Are you jealous of others gains? Do you want to be part of that weeks big thing? If yes to either then do not buy. Jealous trading is bad trading. 

2. Warren Buffet said “be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.” Ask yourself if people are being greedy with the stock you want to buy, do not buy if they are. 

3. Ask yourself “am I being a sheep?” Sheep do not make money on the stock market, they don’t even understand the stock market, they are sheep. Don’t be a sheep. 

4. Where did you see the stock? If it was on the news don’t buy it. If it’s trending on one of the subreddits then it’s probably too late. 

5. Is it often appearing on the subreddit and being regularly pushed by the same small crowd? Watch out cause without proof they are probably bag holders hoping to pass the bag to you. 

6. Can you explain to somebody what the company does and why it is a good idea to buy it? If not then you shouldn’t buy it yourself. 

7. Is the market mostly red or mostly green that week? Sell on green weeks and buy on red weeks. It might feel like the other way around at the time but that’s emotional trading. 
8. Is it a meme stock? If yes then be an early adopter or don’t adopt at all. 

9. Have you got spare capital? If money is no issue to you or if you are making a small punt that won’t harm your finances then go ahead. If you are making a big, late move into a meme stock then you’ll be seeing red. 

10. Does it have emojis in the DD’s? If yes then disregard all previous steps and bet your house on it.",DD,0.82

**The Shorts - The Side Show**

Let’s be honest, the real reason anyone is in WSB right now is to fist shorts. BCRX, however, is also a company that needs to gap up to reach fair value.  Fist the shorts and hold the gains.

Biocryst has a high and steadily growing institutional ownership [currently reported at 71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcrx/institutional-holdings). Biocryst has a float of 175m (124m of which are held by institutions), who are buying every share they can and not likely to sell any time soon.  This leaves 56m tradable shares. [The shorts have 30m shares or 70% of the tradable float.](http://nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest) This is not as big as the $GME naked short taken on by u/DeepFuckingValue. But, we think this is a stock that if it gaps up can hold the gain based on value. Institutions run an algorithm almost every day and short the stock (check the charts). We can make these fuckers squirm with the slightest effort.

HAE is a rare disease that affects roughly 1/50,000 people, or about \~25,000 people in the three regions mentioned previously.

Orladeyo treats a rare disease and that means the medication is expensive.

**Factor D -  The Main Event**

Factor D is the blockbuster.  Full stop.  The company is already pursuing PNH but has indicated their intended subsequent targets for this drug. They’re small targets like “Lupus” and “IGA Nephropathy” along with[ 6 others (page 24)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) and it’s already being hailed as [“best in class”](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3087617&headline=BCRX-BioCryst-has-potential-bestinclass-PNH-treatment-says-JMP-Securities)

So what’s this look like money wise?  Alexion’s drugs SOLIRIS® and ULTOMIRIS® are the current treatment for PNH those [make up 4.3B of their 5B revenues.](https://ir.alexion.com/node/22191/pdf)  AstraZeneca just bought them out for a whopping 39B.  If Factor D receives same valuation, that alone puts SP at $222 given our float.

Just distribute the [galidesivir](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/galidesivir) and most everyone will be protected. (Animal studies suggest high protection against [Zika](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/4/suppl_1/S55/4294108), Yellow Fever, Marburg, [Tick Borne Encephalitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142664/) and others). 

Why didn’t we already have this drug?  That’s anyone’s guess, but politics seems to have something to do with it.  No one can yet determine the value or ultimate use of galidesivir as it is tied up in government development contracts. The company has already [stated](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/biocryst-third-quarter-2020-conference-call) that it is developing galidesivir for government contracts and shareholders seem to have little to do with this. So, we’ll just call this the sleeping wild card.

**The Competition - The Class Clowns**

Disease:  Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)

For the prophylactic (preventative) market, the competitors are Cinryze, Takhzyro (from Takeda) which are IVF and subcutaneous injections respectively. Haegarda (CSL Behring) has a subcutaneous injection as well. Orladeyo recently received [FDA approval](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) to be the first and only oral prophylactic treatment for HAE.

The patents of the competitors expire in 2032 and no generics are expected on the market before 2032. Orladeyo was granted extended patent protection until [2037](https://ir.biocryst.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-composition-matter-patent-allowance-extends-protection). [Royalty Pharma](https://www.royaltypharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/royalty-pharma-acquires-royalty-interest-orladeyo-and-bcx9930) did a deep dive on BioCryst’s expected Orladeyo revenues when it agreed to royalty financing that enabled BCRX to fast track Factor D development and expand it to 8 clinical indications.

[This activist letter ](http://www.elliottletters.com/alexion.pdf)and [this article](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/alexion-moves-from-cfo-clancy-and-his-legendary-caution-does-mean-more-m-a-coming) highlight that analysts believe the 39B purchase of Alexion was a fire sale due to mismanagement. If Factor D received at least the same discounted valuation as ALXN, that would mean its market cap would increase from 1.6B to 39B. Excited?

Factor D is expected not just to be equivalent to Soliris, but exceed it. BioCryst Medical Director Bill Sheridan believes Factor D will make competitors [“obsolete”](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) as it cures patients earlier in the disease process than C5 and C3 inhibitors. Unlike competitors, Factor D will also be both an oral pill \*and\* a monotherapy. In other words, there’s not much competition. Also, PNH is only the first of 8 serious illnesses expected to be treated by Factor D.

**The Insiders**

Still not convinced? CFO Anthony Doyle joined BioCryst April 02, 2020. Four months after joining the company he used $220,320 of his own money to [purchase shares in BioCryst ATM.](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1808688.htm) As he is mortal like the rest of us, we assume CFO Anthony Doyle also pays taxes. Therefore, it appears as if he put the entirety of his after tax salary, for a whole year, into aligning himself with shareholders. Famed biotech investor Alex Denner has also been accumulating a passive position, ATM, right next to retail, [as recently as a couple weeks ago](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-bcrx-biocryst-pharmaceuticals-sarissa-capital-management-lp-sc-13g-2021-january-25-18652).

BCRX researched small molecules and crystalline structures for years.

**No More Shareholder Dilutions**

If your interest is perking, you’ll be happy to hear CEO John Stonehouse [promised(listen to question and answer section)](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) there will be no shareholder dilutions, as all company operations are funded into 2023. The company does not plan to revise guidance.

Positions: GME, BCRX",DD,0.93
GME,lbv6iy,2021-02-03 20:00:11,GME Rollercoaster,"Listen up bag holders, 💎🖐, short bus riders.  

The euphoric feeling you had when you saw GME hit $500 intraday, with dreams of it hitting  $1,000 while yelling,”I’m gonna cooom!!” and the depression accompanying it when it hit $80 yesterday, while you glance at those big, heavy fucking bags in your diamond hands, are nothing new for GME gang. 

It happened in October when it was halted based on MSFT news and then promptly fell back down to earth.  It happened in November/December RC penned the letter to the BoD, run up to earnings where it dropped so hard after omnichannel.  Then RC made a filing to up his stake mid December.  We all know when he tweeted 🥜 around 1/15 opex week.   

After every major drop, GME or RC drops something to quell those doubts. Case in point, they announced 3 new hires today. 

Most of the GME DD prior to the squeeze was that the catalyst for the squeeze would most likely occur in late March/April.  I still stand by that.  

The run up to 1/15 and the subsequent para move was mainly driven by the incredible amount of GME options exp then and the gamma squeeze initiated by retail subsequently sustained by the larger hedge funds.  It always felt inorganic, which was why most current bag holders expected more.  Yes it could’ve reached $1000, 2000, 5000 even - had RH and other brokerages not royally fucked up and fucked every retail trader. Shorts may have covered through redemptions from ETFs with high concentrations of GME shares, they might have covered in other ways.  Who gives a shit.  The fact exists that there are still shorts.  We’ve learned and seen all the dirty tricks in the book thrown our way.  We now know what to be wary about.  We’re not missing our second shot.  
 
Short Squeeze has always been the cherry on top of the GME DD.   The DD was always that it was an undervalued company.  How undervalued is anyone’s guess.  

If restrictions get lifted, and volatility drops a bit, who’s to say gamma squeezes can’t happen again and ride the tendie train every Friday? We seen how TSLA went.  I understand two different industries, valuations, etc.? But gamma squeezes are real and both have asymmetric forward return profile. TSLA rode our FDs like a motherfucker to the moon all last yr. 

If you’ve lost money, you can cut your losses and do what is best for you and your family.  I’m not here to tell you to hold or sell or whatever you want to do with your money/financial decisions.  You can also hold to see how it will play out - you don’t lose if you don’t sell, because there are more catalysts to come (March earnings, 100M shelf offering, share buyback, expansion, LT roadmap).  Again, you do you. 

Just remember, for every high that GME has hit, it’s gone even higher than that in subsequent peaks.  I do think it will go higher than $500 at some point in the near future.  Gut feeling. Call me retarded. Call me crazy.  But that’s what everyone told me when I went in on GME in October.",Discussion,0.97

Diamond hands means diamond hands, you hold, i know greed is a big factor and you want more money but if we want the price to skyrocket (potentially going up to 10k, very possible based on 2008 shorts squeeze) we have to hold.

GME,lblofg,2021-02-03 12:35:03,Why $GME is gonna rise.,"It's not rocket science.

Robinhood's imposed buy limits coincide perfectly with $GME's stock plummeting.

If the demand for stock is: buying it > selling it, it rises.

If it's selling it > buying it, it plummets. And $GME is plummeting because of Robinhood's buying restrictions.

The only hurdle right now is Robinhood's decision to limit $GME share purchases. But everyone is either against or on that case ([Sherrod Brown](https://twitter.com/SenSherrodBrown/status/1354881250922819585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354881250922819585%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Faoc-and-lawmakers-call-for-hearings-on-robinhood-for-freezing-trades-on-gamestop-stock%2F), [Ted Cruz](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354833603943931905%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Faoc-and-lawmakers-call-for-hearings-on-robinhood-for-freezing-trades-on-gamestop-stock%2F), [Attorney General James](https://twitter.com/JonCampbellGAN/status/1354914072194592776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354914072194592776%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Faoc-and-lawmakers-call-for-hearings-on-robinhood-for-freezing-trades-on-gamestop-stock%2F), [AOC](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1354830697459032066), [Elon Musk](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/01/elon-musk-robinhood-clubhouse-gamestop/)).

As long as you don't sell your shares, the sky-fucking-high demand for $GME right NOW is gonna skyrocket its prices—it's garnering worldwide attention.

So hold, even if it's one share. 💎🙌

&#x200B;

Edit (Feb 4, 15:19 GMT) : The logic definitely is over simplified, but I wanted to be short and to the point. Couching my point with a bunch of esoteric financial terms is only gonna obscure what I'm trying to say. Robinhood definitely isn't the only reason the share prices are plummeting. I may have come off that way. I acknowledge that plenty of other brokers have placed purchase restrictions as well. I only  mention Robinhood because they're arguably the biggest source of demand for $GME.",Discussion,0.96

SNDL OR SUNDIAL GROWERS is a **debt-free** cannabis company currently trading at .49 cents, more than **98% down since its ipo price of $13 back in 2019.** It's not just SNDL tho, the ENTIRE CANNABIS SECTOR has **been pressed by short sellers since its peak in 2018**. But these shortsellers are getting scared and shitting their shorts (pun intended) cuz of the recent mega squeezes that we've witnessed in GME, BB, AMC etc. But also cuz **Biden/Kamala administration is in talks of legalizing it on fed level**. So GME, BB (which i bought at $4.10 and wrote a DD on it back in November) and other stocks have **these key things in common with SNDL** when they were about to pop :

1. **GOLDEN Cross  2. Highly Shorted  3. Positive PR 4. Expanding Market 5. Under $10 stock 6. Actively traded by young traders**

**\[UPDATE Jan 28\] ALL THIS PRESSURE ON ROBINHOOD AND OTHER FRAUD CASINO APPS TO REOPEN TRADING RESTRICTIONS TOMORROW WILL CAUSE OUR STONKS TO EXPLODE LIKE PENT UP DIARRHEA 🌋🌋🌋🌋**

House always wins but not if we all unite and fight against it. Restricting our baby penny $SNDL from trading was truly a blessing in disguise. It has now caught the attention of the mass media and we're getting free coverage along with $GME, $AMC etc. Even Dave Portnoy (Barstool guy) is ticker tagging $SNDL on his tweets who is also in the center of all this sh!tstorm.

It's the unemployed bankrupting hedgefunds. Throw away your old valuations and look at this new. This is a movement....and there's fucking value in that!

How high can this go? This is where Ryan Cohen shines. We never know how far he will take this, but I know the dude is fucking brilliant. So fucking brilliant that I'm willing to give him my entire 401k to make this happen.

GameStop is no longer a retailer, it is a viral company. We need to value it like a viral company. Look at Dollar Shave Club. (Almost) everyone buys razors and doesn't give a shit where they come from. But DSC changed everything. People WANTED to buy razors from DSC. I believe we will WANT to buy from GameStop. Fuck, I love this company (and stock) so much, if GameStop starts selling razors, I will buy them.

Dollar Shave Club was sold to Unilever for $1billion when sales were around $100million ($200million projected). I believe GameStop has more value. They are going to increase sales 3x or 4x. They will increase their online presence and start selling more products. This is going to be huge. My valuation of GameStop is 15x current sales, or $1,398.85 per share and my target price is $2,797.70 within 2 years. 

The short squeeze will push this stock even higher, but for the long term the current price is a bargain.

I'M HOLDING THIS STOCK!

I know GameStop is a good retail company and I'm confident they will grow after this, but it is also personal. The criminals who paused my trades need to go to jail. When they get out, I want them to see a fucking GameStop store everywhere they go. Every shopping center, every mall, fucking everywhere! I want Gamestop to be bigger than Walmart. To do my part, I will buy everything from Gamestop. If they sell toiletpaper, I'll fucking buy.

GME,l9ywyz,2021-02-01 09:58:35,Things to remember on Monday if you hold GME stock,"# Remember hedge funds have the weak hand

They had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.

# Expect some crazy volatility

Remember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).

# Manage your risk

I hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.

The important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.

# Be a critical thinker, do your DD

There is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say ""see, they didn't know what they were doing"". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.

Do your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver. 

# BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.

Maybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

DO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.

HOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.

BEWARE OF SILVER.

For SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.

Edit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.

Edit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.

Edit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules.

The process involves your new broker sending a request to RH requesting to move your portfolio over. When RH gets that request they will IMMEDIATELY freeze your account entirely.  You won’t be able to do anything through RH anymore.  


The process will normally take 3-5 business days but I’m sure with all the insanity going on it’s likely to take considerably longer.

We're buying the dips. We're applying the pressure.  We're juicing the squeeze, which has yet to squoze.  More diamond handing will be demanded of us. And we'll handle it no sweat.  

It's just math.  The hedgies are fucked.  We sit on our shares, and they bleed.  Not blood of course, but the only thing they care about.

Money.

We're hitting em in the only place they care about - their wallets.  We're actually getting our chance.  To get back some of the money that they soaked up for destroying the economy in 2008.  To get out of debt.  To pay the bills.  To buy a house.  To pay for the treatment. To have a retirement.

This is the first hopeful, dare I say optimistic time in many of our lives.  Not only at the prospect of making some perhaps life changing money, nor only to put the screws to the elites that fuck us over without a second thought.  But at how unifying this experience has been.  I feel a bond with each of you, for holding strong through the ups and downs, and diamond handing with ice in your veins and steel in your glare.  Memes are on point too.

There was no massive selloff.  The volume was low.  We made it through this last week.  We can make it through this next one. And on for however long the shorts would like to continue bleeding.

We *will* have our infinite squeeze.

And it will be glorious.

DD,lbaww3,2021-02-03 01:24:57,DD on APHA,"I think it is time I make a DD post that has nothing to do with a meme stonk. I am unable to use emojis off my laptop so please excuse me for not having enough rocket ships but I promise you this rocket ship is fueling up and we are a couple months away from blast off if not sooner.

Why should you trust me?

I am an economics major with a concentration in entrepreneurship and a minor in sales. I love money more than hookers love blow and I intend on making a lot of money so I can afford the hookers that like blow. I go to a pretty prestigious university and I love how WallStreetBets can connect ""smart"" money with ""autist"" money. I am 100% all in on APHA with my entire life savings because as Warren Buffett would say, "" ""**Diversification** is a protection against ignorance,"" ""\[It\] makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing.""  and I know what I am doing so I full sent it.

&#x200B;

Why APHA?

They are conservative with their spending is what got me hooked first. Compared to other marijuana companies like ACB or Tilray, they aren't riddled with debt right off the back. (i'll get to the Tilray merger in a bit). This company has the cash on hand to purchase a MSO (multi-state operator) as soon as the US legalizes and my bet is that they are going to go for a MSO that has a heavy presence in Florida as the CFO stated in an AMA on reddit that Florida is where the market is, not California. The difference between APHA and any MSO or other LP is the fact that APHA merging with Tilray creates the first MCO or Multi-country operator. This means the company will be taking a piece of the cake from multiple cakes. You don't need to be #1 in America or Canada whenever you are directly engaged in multiple operations all over the world that increase your market share to be #1 worldwide.

&#x200B;

With APHA and Tilray merging... which stonk do you buy? Easy, APHA.

The arbitrage play has APHA being changed to .83 of 1 Tilray share.

Currently tilray trades at 24.95 x 0.83 = 20.708

The current APHA price? 15.25.

This means that the gap has to close before the merger but is Tilray going to go down with all the pro marijuana news coming out? No, APHA has to go up to close the gap and today alone APHA is up 17.92% based on pro marijuana legalization news. BUT WAIT! Tilray is up 22.98% which means the GAP IS ONLY GETTING WIDER just like your wife's pussy after letting her 5 boyfriends have a turn since you've been so busy focusing on your GME stonk going down due to market manipulation.

&#x200B;

The financials of APHA are strong, they FINALLY posted a profit of 0.01 EPS which may seem like little bitch shit but in reality most cannabis companies haven't hit profitability yet so they are ahead of the game. The one great thing about their financials is that Sweetwater Brewing wasn't factored into the earnings report which is AWESOME (Insert hellllaaa rocket emojis here). They are already turning a profit and THEN they are going to be adding more profits from a brewery that has strong revenue growth and turns a profit onto their balance sheet. While other companies have to figure out how to keep demand up after the holiday season, APHA has a raft to float on since Sweetwater provides a great level of float to the company. (I will post all relevant news articles at the end). The merge with Tilray makes this combined company a player in, Canada, Portugal, France, and then Sweetwater gives them US brand recognition. How does a beer company give US brand recognition? Look up the Sweetwater brand and you will see that this is a beer company for stoners and that is exactly what APHA needed. Right now the stock is stilling at $15 which is still relatively low, I can see this hitting anywhere from $50-75 EOY and like I said, I have my entire life savings in this stonk because I know the end of prohibition means the chance for the next Anheuser Busch which APHA is best positioned to become.

There's even more reasons to invest but I'm sure you get the point. This is going to be huge and if you're looking for a play in the marijuana sector this is your best option. Go on the weedstocks subreddit if you want even more verification or to see some alternative opinions. I made this post as a throwback to the good ole days to when WSB wasn't only about GME and AMC but also new emerging sectors. This is a great stock and I wouldn't have taken the time out of my busy schedule unless the time to blast off was fast approaching. Listen or don't I am gonna make tendies, I just want to share the wealth.

Sweetwater is actually a very big deal that is overlooked. They are expanding into more states which is simply creating a distribution chain for APHA/Tilray to distribute their product through. Imagine already having warehouses, sales reps, and shipping routes established before the US legalizes. APHA is going to be an MSO and MCO. The only thing that scares me is that democrats have said they don't want big companies coming in to sweep up market share whenever minorities have been directly impacted by the war on drugs. Could go both ways but Sweetwater provides somewhat of a foundation for the balance sheet and then the intrinsic value of the relationships/brand recognition that will already be established before any other LPs can get into the market will have APHA/Tilray the clear cut winner of the LPs. I strongly urge anyone that wants to get further into the marijuana investing space to visit the sub reddit Weedstocks rather than spamming WSB with these types of posts whenever their is a different sub dedicated to it. I have been a member of WSB and Weedstocks for over a year and both subs have their pros and cons.

BB,kxknrl,2021-01-15 03:12:58,BB DD: 9 Reasons Why BB is 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 from former BB employee,"Key qualitative strengths why BB is winning cybersecurity. Some stuff from my head, others from presentation at JP Morgan conference. I have been long BB since June 2019, waiting for this pop to happen. I used to work at RIM/BB (10 years ago) - nothing confidential here but I know the security culture well.

1. **Pervasive security culture** that's decades long from history of building the most secure phones, networks, and servers. End to end encryption is not a new thing to BB. It has been a thing since the very very early days. Only in the last few years are other companies starting to talk about it. I worked there 10 years ago and the security culture was insane. It was harder to go into the prototype plant (RIM 8) than airport security. There's a reason why BB sold phones without cameras because we needed them ourselves. If your BB had a camera, you leave it at the door with security.🚀
2. **Strong customer base** of critical infrastructure that cannot fail or get hacked - think nuclear power plants, the International Space Station, and cars driving down the road. All the top G20 governments, all the top 10 global banks. Remember Obama had a cell phone. It was a BlackBerry and was the first device ever to get approved for use by a president. This was 2008 but he wasn't using a fucking iPhone.🚀🚀
3. **Strong enterprise and government sales experience** \- BB has so much experience selling into the enterprise. B2B sales is not easy as any startup would know but they have been able to do so since the first RIM pager, to BlackBerry smartphones, and enterprise servers. Back in the day, BlackBerry was the only phone to work in disasters because they had dedicated networks and servers - BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) and BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). All your traffic gets routed separately from the general public.🚀🚀🚀
4. QNX **security certifications** for defense, government, automotive, medical, industrial.  ISO 26262 ASIL D, 61508 ASIL 3. These come from a fundamental design principles used for QNX and if competitors are to copy, they would have to start from scratch. QNX hypervisor uses microkernel virtualization to compartmentalize critical processes from non-critical ones. So if you have your autonomous driving or steering system controlled by BB software, your music app that gets hacked ain't touching the steering system. Other companies run through the same kernel, meaning that it is easier to hack.🚀🚀🚀🚀
5. Customer **markets are growing massively. Autonomous driving and connected cars** is blowing up. That means automakers need to either build their own or buy secure software platforms. Considering the cost and time, everyone is buying (except maybe Tesla). As more cars are connected, you also attract more hackers and bad actors, which make automakers more likely to buy industry leading platforms like BB. It's a positive feedback loop. And more customers on this same platform mean more and more security because it makes fixed costs (hiring engineers) make more sense. More customers > more secure > more customers > more secure.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
6. Most cars use multiple chips to run the different systems. One for the infotainment, one for the drive system, one for the dashboard, etc. Increasingly, automakers are consolidating into single, high performance controllers (ECUs). What this means is that point A.4 above is increasingly more relevant, because a single chip needs to be uber secure. **QNX is designed for this. And 19 of the top 25 EVs already use QNX**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
7. **AWS partnership to create middleware (IVY)** that allows more companies to build applications to use with the QNX platform. You can have all the best tech in the world, but if no one knows how to use it, or no one has easy access to it, it's useless. Well, this solves that problem as software engineers can now build on it much more easily. SWEs are like water and they use the tools with least resistance. This will create an ecosystem that Amazon and BB will push to the OEMs together.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
8. AWS IVY (the middleware) is OS and **cloud agnostic**. This means that if Amazon is being a shit partner, they can leave and move somewhere else. Obviously this is not ideal and would require some work, but it's not the end of the world. What this means is that Amazon won't be able to hold BB hostage with more fees if this takes off. It's **50/50 partnership with Amazon**. Think of the concept where you are a restaurant and you are getting good sales. The landlord sees that and they raise your rent. Well shit, you just did more work and your profits stay the same.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
9. **Pivot from hardware to software means subscription revenue.** What this means is that it is going to go on forever and customer has zero leverage until they want to rebuild their software. If you're an OEM and you build a car around this platform, you're paying BB until you redesign the car from the ground up - all the while you are paying BB every, single, fucking month. And if the OEM's contract with BB is running out, well, BB can raise their rates even higher. What is the OEM going to do? Stop producing a car and spin up another platform, redesign another car around that platform, and retool factories to build it? That takes years and billions, so they pony up to BB whatever fee increases they want. This is how AWS makes so much money.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

GME,l3mpmw,2021-01-23 23:58:27,Disgraceful &amp; false media narrative about GME,"Dear fellow retards & autists,

The shit-tier level of journalism covering the GME saga has been a fucking disgrace. Half of it is plain financial illiteracy, and the other half is inter-generational bashing and fear-mongering. You think it's been bad thus far? The squeeze hasn't even really set off yet, can you imagine what happens next week when the stock hits the low triple digits? Eventually to 420.69? End game of 1000$+? Lets recap what has happened so far:

**False media narrative #1**: Recent rise of GME is due to sHorT sQuoZe!!!1! 

**Reality**: GME is an undervalued company & a turnaround story. Investors are finally starting to notice. Short squeeze hasn't even started yet.

*January 13th* - We had our first breakout to 30$ from the sub-20$ doldrums, the shit-tier level reporting started immediately. The media went balls deep on the short squeeze narrative despite absolutely no evidence that shorts had covered at all. Rather it was just long buyers piling in. For example, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/heavily-shorted-gamestop-soars-most-ever-as-day-traders-circle) titles their article ""GameStop Surges Most Ever in Short Squeeze After Cohen Move"" despite quoting Ihor Dusaniwsky stating the opposite in the body of the article.

*January 14-15th* - The stock bounced from the mid to high 30's. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/01/15/with-138-short-interest-board-change-sends-gamestop-stock-soaring/?sh=21052b426da8) reports ""What drove up GameStop’s shares was a short-squeeze on steroids."" despite no evidence to support that claim and while quoting Ihor Dusaniwsky saying the actual catalyst was due to stronger holiday sales & board shakeup. 

*January 22nd* - GME breaks out yet again - hitting the low 70's before settling to the 60's. [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/gamestop-soars-nearly-70percent-trading-briefly-halted-amid-epic-short-squeeze.html) proceeds to again spread the falsehood about ""massive short covering"" with absolutely no evidence to back that up. Rather the bump was a result of a gamma squeeze.

**False media narrative #2**: Rabid retail investors are victimizing the poor short sellers 

**Reality**: Short sellers have been conducting illegal naked short selling to drive a company employing tens of thousands to bankruptcy.

[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/gamestop-tug-of-war-gives-reddit-army-a-win-on-record-volatility) blithly characterizes reddit as an ""angry mob"" out to attack poor little Citron. Bullshit, an angry mob is what stormed DC on Jan 6th, not a bunch of random individuals that left internet comments you didn't agree with on your youtube video. No mention of Citron's far shadier and illicit history. 

[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/gamestop-stock-wall-street-bets-short-squeeze/) re-urgitates Andrew Left's baseless claims of being ""hacked"" and ""harrassed by pizza deliveries"". No mention of Citron's  track-record of making baseless fraud allegation and market manupulation

[WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/short-bets-pummel-hot-hedge-fund-melvin-capital-11611349217) sympathetically mentioned ""Many investors have complained about short squeezes that have left them nursing losses."" and then going on to write a gushing biography about Gabe Plotkin. No mention of illegal naked short selling or that Gabe drove GME all the way down to 3$ but was too greedy to lock in his profits.

We, the retail investors, didn't do shit other than invest into a company that deserves a second chance. The shorts put themselves into a precarious situation through their own greed and illegal naked short selling. The media wants to punch down on the ""easy"" target: Reddit and WSB. Reddit is scary to boomers who can barely navigate the reddit UI, let alone get an erection. They prefer facebook, where fake news can be piped directly into their senile brains. This mis-information will just get worse from here on out.

We can and should push back, not by some centralized WSB twitter handle, but by what we do best: acting as individual retail investors who advocate for the truth on our soapboxes of choice.

YOU,l8uu76,2021-01-30 21:25:46,The $GME squeeze will bring down Melvin. The Silver squeeze will bring down the biggest banks in the world. That's why Robinhood barred trading of $SLV the day after they took a billion dollars in loans from JPM and Goldman Sachs. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.,"You retarted apes are growing up. I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

&#x200B;

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

CAREFUL, YOU ARE BEING PLAYED BY THE MOST POWERFUL ELITE ON THE PLANET!!!","# THIS IS A META THREAD IN WHICH I'M JUST DOING 2 THINGS: RANTING AND LINKING TO OTHER DD THREADS THAT PREDATE GME MOONING BY MONTHS, THUS CALLING BULLSHIT ON THE 6 MILLION NEW DEGENERATES THAT ""HAVE NEVER SEEN A SLV JPM SQUEEZE IDEA IN THIS SUB BEFORE THE SUITS WANTED TO SAVE MELVIN"".

Do you realize reddit has a search function? Here is a list of posts that talk about a potential silver squeeze of SLV and JPM long, long, long before GME blasted off towards the moon. This is /r/wallstreetbets, not /r/GME. We trade multiple tickers, you dumbshit fucking ""entry at $450"" bag holding tards.

Great, you joined in the last 2 weeks because your autistic nephew made more money in 2 months than you've ever done.

Instead of just shutting up and watching the plethora of good DD posts rise and fall, you think this entire subreddit is only about holding one frickin' short squeeze as if that's the first time in history anyone got squoze, and downvote otherwise great research because you're frickin' terrified of losing money you couldn't afford to lose in the first place.

The entire global media didn't all pool together in 48 hours to present a uniform story of ""buy silver"" as part of some frickin' conspiracy designed to save a few medium-sized American hedge funds. No more than COVID was made by the Chinese to win Biden the presidency, anyway.

So here, since you guys are too damn handicapped to use a fucking search engine, are a list of DD/YOLO/Discussion posts about SLV and Silver written LONG BEFORE THE FUCKING GME SHORT SQUEEZE FINALLY ROCKETED!!! Jesus fuck, you tinfoil wearing sack of ""fake news"" American mouth-breathers with the collective IQ of a doorknob.

Just look at the fucking DD and pretend GME doesn't exist for 5 minutes. Silver. Is. A. Deep. Fucking. Value. Play! It has value. So much fucking deep value! 

Yeah, no shit a market maker is holding silver positions when silver becomes more sought after, their job is to make fucking markets liquid. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY IF YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT TO SUPPLY?! DID YOU NOTICE HOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF PUTS AND A LOT OF CALLS, AND NOT JUST CALLS?!

DO YOU THINK NO BILLIONAIRES HELPED RIDE GME UP? Do you think it was 100% retail on one side and 100% Melvin and Citron on the other? Ah, you do. Of course, you do.  


GREAT, WE GOT 8 MILLION DEGENERATES HERE. The 6M that didn't manage to find this place without hearing about GME having rocketed already, MAYBE DON'T FUCKING POST, COMMENT AND BRING YOUR DAMN IGNORANCE INTO A SUB THAT WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDING 2-10 DECENT TRADE IDEAS PER WEEK PRIOR TO THIS CULT FUCKING INFESTATION OF JACKASSES COSPLAYING RETARDS.

Whatever, here's a list none of you fuckers are capable of reading:

\- 5 months ago, /u/negovany wrote ""[Cornering Silver Market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/idjk61/cornering_silver_market/)"". The whole thing is about JPM and squeezing silver. $GME was at $5 back then and /u/DeepFuckingValue was still getting laughed at for buying at every opportunity. Rest of you fuckers had barely gotten over the last cult following, PRPL mattresses.  
\- 6 months ago, /u/lucasandrew talks about ""[Why you should trade futures - WSB Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3qkex/why_you_should_trade_futures_wsb_edition/)"", in which he mentions ""*Speaking of SLV, people have been posting all the reasons that JPM fucks with the SLV ETF*"". Yeah, I bet he took a fucking time-machine back 6 months in time after Citadel got stuck in the boo-boo. 

\- 6 months ago, /u/LE0TARD0 implores the ""[SILVER CHAD'S RISE UP!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy7nvn/silver_chads_rise_up/)"". A straight fundamental thread on why silver is undervalued, not mention JPM. However, in the comments, a thread is started by /u/kbtech18 and supplemented by /u/ayyayyron talking about precisely JPM and their price manipulation of silver. YEAH, NO THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I'M SORRY FOR BEING A SHILL, LIKE FUCKING TAKE YOUR TINFOIL HATS OFF YOU DUMB SHITS!

\- 5 months ago, /u/Fuzzers wrote ""[September Silver Futures Contact - Something Aint Right Kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9b1th/september_silver_futures_contact_something_aint/)"".  
After hailing his fellow degenerates, HE IMMEDIATELY SAYS: ""*I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver,""* before later writing ""*A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts."".* Isn't IT JUST GLORIOUS HOW MELVIN AND CITADEL HAVE ALL THESE TIME MACHINES TO MAKE UP IMAGINARY SILVER SQUEEZES 6 MONTHS BEFORE THEY WERE MADE UP? YOU GUYS ARE SO FUCKING DUMB RIGHT NOW, HOLY FUCK! DON'T INVEST IN SILVER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, BUT PLEASE STOP WITH THE AMERICAN FAKE NEWS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, IT HURTS MY ALREADY FUCKED UP BRAIN, STOP, I DON'T CONSENT!

\- 5 months ago (YOU GUYS, MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT, ALL THE POSTS ARE FROM 5-6 MONTHS AGO, MAYBE IT REALLY IS A TIME TRAVELLING CONSPIRACY BY MELVIN AND CITADEL, YES, LET'S GO WITH THAT!), /u/jetter23, wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6l0o2/weekend_update_silver/)"". What did he have to share, in terms of ideas and DD? "" *4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short,*  "". WHAT SNEAKY FRICKIN' MARKET MANIPULATING HEDGE FUND SHILL HE IS, JUST GOING BACK SO FAR IN TIME TO SET US UP FOR THE PERFECT TRAP TO HELP CITADEL!!!

\- /u/jetter23 was quite active shilling 5 months ago, he also wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver (DD#3)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9uxok/weekend_update_silver_dd3/)"", where he just casually mentioned ""*JPM is currently under DOJ investigation AGAIN for price speculation on Silver. JPM is learning a VERY expensive lesson that when there is a pandemic, global FIAT currencies are crashing(like the DXY), and there is a run on physical metals - you can't be naked short on paper.""* IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF SILVER SHORT SQUEEZE ON JPM, BUT HEY, THAT CAN'T BE IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A SCAM FAKE NEWS IDEA THAT'S 2-3 DAYS OLD, RIGHT? 

\- /u/CCJ_Moon_6969 popped his head into the stream of tachyons, relatively talking to us from the present all the way 6 months ago, when he wrote ""[Silver. $SLV call options. New York Comex.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy8wv9/silver_slv_call_options_new_york_comex/)"". Do you remember /u/kbtech18 from a few threads up? WELL, GEE WHIZ, HE COVERED THAT TIME STREAM TOO, talking about JPM and silver. 6 months ago. I mean, today. Reddit probably changed the timestamps on the posts. DAMN SHILLS!  
\- /u/rawvi wrote ""[JPM and Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i88cyy/jpm_and_silver/)"" 5 months ago, wanting to learn more about... time travel. Nothing to do with naked shorting of silver. BECAUSE THAT WASN'T EVER TALKED ABOUT ON THIS UNTIL 2 DAYS AGO, SO LIKE... HAH, HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ASKING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?!?!

I made it clear in the message that the SEC adopted the rules on naked short selling after the GFC of 2008, hopefully to get some journalist wet with click-baity anticipation, drawing a direct line of Wall Street incompetence from then to now.

GME,l3etpg,2021-01-23 17:08:49,Tax Reduction Strategy for GME holders about to get bitch slapped by the IRS in 2021. Also a way to boost revenues to close out Q4 earnings (and beyond).,"Disclaimer: I am not a tax expert. This is just my retarded brain trying to think through this idea. I’m also not the first to propose this idea. Just remember I can’t read so I didn’t see those other posts. 

For those that have made mountains of sweet, sweet tendies from the GME 🚀🚀, I am wondering if the income tax increase that many of us will realize this year can be reduced by also helping our Tendiemaker directly. This is more specific to Itemized tax filers. If you file Standard, this will only benefit up to $300, which would still be a big deal if tons of us did this up to $300. Itemized filers can deduct up to 60% of their AGI.

Edit: it was brought up that the $300 deduction only applies if the cash donation is given directly to the charity. I’m not verifying it, but it sounds plausible enough.

Edit 2: As u/whitemarshian points out, a better alternative to this strategy could be to donate the shares directly to a donor advised fund. I had not considered this strategy, but this also sounds like good shit. Maybe someone could expand upon this thought and put together another post exploring this?

SUPER EDIT: As u/MichaelVicksPitbull points out, buying gift cards will show up on the balance sheet as Unearned Revenue. This increase in liabilities would be offset by the increase in cash from purchasing the gift cards, so there isn’t really a net advantage for GME’s financials until the gift card is redeemed. This would be an unlikely benefit for Q4.

So here it is. Everyone fortunate enough to be aboard this moon shot heads over to their local GME before 1/31, and we collectively buy what amounts to hopefully millions of dollars in GME gift cards. We take those gift cards and donate them to The Ronald McDonald House or a local Children’s Hospital (St. Jude’s is well known, but I would suggest keeping your donations local to help your community) for them to buy electronics for their patients and patient families. My wife works for a Children’s Hospital, and there are many “entertainment areas” packed with electronics throughout the hospital where sick children get a chance to escape the fight and reality of being sick. This is also an extraordinary relief for young family members of patients and parents as they can be occupied while their sibling or child undergoes tests or procedures or whatever.

We would be giving revenue a huge shot in the arm whenever the gift cards are redeemed, give GME tons of cash to end Q4, and by donating the gift cards to local charities you can reduce the tax burden on your gainz. This will also be a way for us to change the narrative and show those currently besmirching the name of WSB that we aren’t an army, we aren’t some nefarious insider trading collective, nor are we the thieves we are being painted out to be. We’re just a bunch of smooth brains trying to make money or lose it all for the sake of sweet sweet internet points.

Doing this would also not only give you 🚀🚀🚀🚀 in your heart, but bless you with more 🚀🚀🚀🚀 when GME hits $1,000.

If my true retardation is missing any of the key points, please let me know where I am misinterpreting the tax code and I will gladly amend this post.

Position: 1,450 stonks, 4/16 $30c and 7/16 $35c

More obligatory rockets: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

TL:DR: Buy GME gift cards, donate them to The Ronald McDonald House or a local Children’s Hospital. Help sick children and their families. Reduce tax burden. Increase WSB love.

GME,l76f74,2021-01-28 20:39:31,This is why you should HOLD Shares and BUY more GME regardless of current price or volatility,"For those new comers who dont understand what is going on with Gamestop. As you can see there are 69.75M outstanding shares of which 46.89M shares are float (meaning they are available on the market to trade, other shares are held by the GME corp, CEO etc). The Shares (short) as of Jan 14 2021 shows  61.78M shares short. Meaning when there are only 46.89M shares available on the market, the shorted shares are more than the available ones. They need your shares to get out of their short positions. They have shorted more shares then the number of shares which exist. If you people HOLD or BUY more shares, the higher the value goes once the squeeze happens (When their short contracts expire, they would have to buy. If there are no shares to buy, the price goes to the Moon and beyond because of simple demand and supply. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today was a ladder attack which showed very low volume when the stock was halted. It was there to scare off investors. Everyone should keep their shares held to themselves and buy more at any given price. May Gamestop be the most valuable company for a while on the squeeze just like Volkswagen did back in 2008.

&#x200B;

P.S ignore people who are buying BB, AMC, NOK because they think there may be a squeeze with those companies too or think they are too late to jump into GME squeeze. Remember, the squeeze will happen eventually. Volkswagen squeeze took almost 2 years, but GME will be wayyyy quicker because of the spread of the news and the sheer amount of people jumping in.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy GME in any way or HOLD it if you cant buy more.

&#x200B;

P.S: This is not financial advice. I LIKE THE STOCK THATS WHY I AM BUYING IT.

How to Buy GME etc \[Loophole\]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1. Go to Feb 5 option.
2. Scroll all the way down the call list
3. Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx%
4. Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!! TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE!!!! HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD

GME,l8uu76,2021-01-30 21:25:46,The $GME squeeze will bring down Melvin. The Silver squeeze will bring down the biggest banks in the world. That's why Robinhood barred trading of $SLV the day after they took a billion dollars in loans from JPM and Goldman Sachs. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.,"You retarted apes are growing up. I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

&#x200B;

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

IT,l6qilh,2021-01-28 08:02:07,GME: Massive increase in gamma squeeze severity if price remains high till EOD Friday. AKA Buying and holding IS WORKING. KEEP IT UP.,"See my previous post first to understand the story thus far:

https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l60euz/theory_the_hold_is_working_and_the_squeeze_is/

# Wed 01-27

Fantastic trading day. 


Up 97% on the day to close out at $345 battling all through the $300s all day.


Curiously small amounts of volume all day leads me to believe this was small
amounts of short covering and paper hands selling on each bump (we'll know more
when Ortex posts data in the morning).


Yes it took a bit of a dip in the after market, but I expect greatness from our German
brothers and sisters to keep the momentum up today. The plan is the same: buy and hold. 

# *It is working*.

What's most interesting rn is the new $ amount of calls about to expire.


I had to compile a spreadsheet for this from multiple sources because my usual
source didn't have the complete data (highly sus? Are they trying to hide this
data?)

Spreadsheet:

https://imgur.com/a/zXTeR4t

This is essentially just the options chain you can look up. But, if you take
the Open Interest (how many contracts are alive), multiply that by the latest
close price * 100 and then sum all the contracts you get the total amount of $ of shares that are about to be
exercised. 

What's crazy about GME right now?

# EVERY CLIT LICKING CALL IS ITM

That is *insane*. Never seen it before.


Tuesday ended with all those options worth $800mill 


Wednesday? They jumped to $3.5 *billion* and it will continue to rise as share prices rises. Buy and hold.


Two things are gonna happen b/c of this:


-1. Mega Gamma Squeeze. MM's who weren't properly hedged before are about to be (they will have to buy shares on the market
in order to cover these calls expiring higher than their delta position). But remember, all you degens are buying and holding, so there's low af volume and prices skyrocket with every share we *force* them to buy. Read this:
https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/26/gamestops-gargantuan-gamma-squeeze/


tl;dr


> If the stock continues to rise, the market maker's delta position also
> becomes increasingly negative at a faster rate due to gamma, requiring more
> buying, which pushes the stock even higher still, and so forth. This
> phenomenon is known as a gamma squeeze and the feedback loop resembles a
> regular short squeeze.

*feedback loop* you say? 

# Sounds like tendie rocket to me if everyone holds.

-2. Many of these shares can be exercised into proper diamond hands instead of in MM's accounts that will 
loan them back out to shorts. Further squozing the squeezees. This, however requires the owner to put up another position to
exercise.


Moral of the story:


If GME holds or even goes up further Thur & Fri this gamma squeeze could very
likely be the catalyst for the big squeeze come next week.


And it will be *epic*.

SPOT,l8eate,2021-01-30 05:59:14,We're all in a REALLY GOOD SPOT with Gamestop,"Here's what I've been seeing these last couple of days that gives me a LOT of hope that the squeeze on GME is working. Aside from media and billionaires freaking out, which gives me confidence that this is real, let's take a look at some other examples.

At the beginning of this week, we were looking at volumes close to 150-200M. That volume obviously took a hit yesterday when many brokers decided to stop allowing purchases, but even today, the trading volume was relatively low. Additionally, the stock price has continued to increase all of these days indicating that there are more shares BOUGHT than sold. The price is around $315 and most people STILL aren't selling, indicated by the low volume today (Friday). That means this price will likely hold as a baseline since we keep taking more shares away from the float and are holding onto it.

This has become a movement though, and more and more people are willing to purchase a ticket to stick it to wall street. You think fewer people are going to get involved...hell no! More people want in on this, with those from Canada, Australia, UK, Germany, and across the world getting in on this. If people keep buying more shares and holding, there will be fewer shares available for trading and we'll likely see even less volume in the days ahead. How do we know they'll hold...well most of those getting in now are doing so to stick it to wall street so they don't mind losing some money if it comes to it. Most importantly, this means THEY WILL HOLD! Plus, a smaller accessible float means the price will rise or at least stay stable, neither of which is sustainable for hedge funds. This does NOT end well for them in any way.

The squeeze may not happen immediately, but as the number of available shares decreases, the probability for an imminent squeeze gets better since the hedge funds will be margin called and have to buy to cover. In fact, the longer this goes on, the more epic the squeeze becomes at this point. They're still short >100% and the number of float available becomes less and less everyday as more people buy and HOLD. Its really only a matter of time...so keep the faith!",Discussion,0.99

GME,l2zk5e,2021-01-23 00:09:53,A hedge fund managers perspective on GME,"I am a hedge fund manager (long-short, derivative mixed equity fund primarily value focused with some growth). In the past we have been value holders of GME three other times and started a small position today nears it's intraday high and will likely add to this next week should the stock fall.   Previously all my Reddit comments have involved my e-Skate collection or my landing of my airplane in challenging conditions (see: [https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0](https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0)) However, I can't resist commenting on the fascinating technical factors that likely will continue to propel this issue higher - perhaps significantly so over the next few weeks.  Andrew Left's mocking derision of retail investors may prove to be his waterloo.  Why would a value focused fund manager buy a stock that based on classic fundamental value analysis appears significantly overvalued?  

GME appears to be a very interesting example of individual stock reflexivity.  What is reflexivity you ask?  This is the theory, originally promoted by George Soros that the stock market itself can cause the economy to either rise of fall (as opposed to the classic teaching that the economy affects the stock market).  An example of market reflexivity would be the great depression whereby a crashed market brought down an economy that was only in an ordinary recession, or the recent improvement in the economy, not withstanding Covid, which has followed a rising market.  In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.  Why?

1. As the price of the stock rises, GME finds itself in the enviable position where it can use it's stock at currency to buy complementary businesses it could not otherwise afford - monetization of the current short squeeze by the enterprise will lead to fundamentally higher revenue and profits of the enterprise should they find good strategic acquisitions to further monetize their large retail customer base (which has real and to date largely untapped value).  The company is likely right now on the hunt for a major acquisition that could fundamentally alter the companies future prospects with that acquisition largely paid for on the back of short seller covering.
2. Monetization of the short covering increase in share price via issue of a secondary .   The $500 million in debt (net of cash) the company currently has could be entirely extinguished with a secondary that is dilutive of only 10% of the equity base.  In fact such a secondary will, despite this dilution, likely result in a significant price rise for the stock (versus the usual fall in price after most, but not all, secondaries).  Bankruptcy risk will largely be eliminated with this secondary as will interest rate risk and financing costs ultimately increasing cash flow per share.  A 20% secondary will leave the company in a strong cash positive position with this cash available for expansion of sales efforts, cloud offerings, acquisitions, etc.
3. Directly increased sales and revenue by virtue of the large amount of attention this epic short squeeze has brought to the company.  I suspect most long retail stockholders have explored the companies web offerings and are considering becoming customers.  This is free advertising to people with money who are tech savvy and the exact demographic GME would target with paid advertising.  
4. Retention and efforts of existing management now becomes easy.  Every manager there wants to see this continue.  Operations at companies with sinking share prices typically suffer as management and employees leave the enterprise or develop anger and lassitude (think Sears Holdings).   The opposite is occurring here with every manager trying to beat their numbers to see the squeeze continue.
5. This issue remains extremely heavily shorted.  Despite the squeeze that has already occurred, other ""value"" based investors have dived into short positions as the price has risen.  The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well.  Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time.  Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs.  We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the ""hard to borrow"" desk.  No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers.  This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue.  As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.

Impossible to know really where the stock goes from here as there does currently exist a disconnect from fundamentals. However, the extreme short position against the unrestricted common float here suggests to me there is a much greater chance of GME's price continuing to increase, perhaps significantly so, and this chance is far greater than the now fearful pundit in hiding's proclamation that the stock would soon see $20.

For what it's worth, over the past 13 years of this funds life, we have significantly beaten both the overall market and the dow,  (12.2%/year margin over DJIA inclusive of dividends since 2008).  We  have had plenty of losing issues despite this beat but also way more big winners, some really big.  Right now my money's with the retail investors who are long GME.  We only have a small position here but this may prove a big winner for us also.  Cheers.",Discussion,0.97
DD,l3o334,2021-01-24 01:10:08,BB DD Bull case 100x by 2030,"Retard TLDR:

BlackBerry IVY is like the browser, it unlocks a shit ton of monetization opportunities. BB 100x by 2030. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

IVY is the upcoming vehicle data platform built by BB with AWS providing the infrastructure.

According the McKinsey, potential revenue generated by car data will reach 450-750B by 2030. This was written back in 2016 so I'd say this estimate should be at least 50% higher. Thanks JPOW.

I think by 2030, BB will have this sector BY THE BALLS. BB QNX is already in cars manufactured by TOYOTA, HONDA, GM, FORD, MERCEDES-BENZ, VW GROUP, BMW, HYUNDAI, MASERATI (FCA, Now STELLANTIS), JAGUAR (TATA MOTORS). That's literally ALL of the major car companies in the world. By having an existing business relationship with them BB will take them to bed and make sweet love to them with their IVY dildo.

If you look at current ""platform"" revenue models from VISA to AAPL, the platform can take in anywhere from 2.5% to 30% of the revenue. Given a 50% market share and 15% revenue share that would be 50B revenue a year for BB. Thats ONLY from cars. They can expand the data platform to other embedded platforms like... anything you fucking want. By 2030 Starbucks' coffee cup's gonna be an embedded system.

Risks:

Car companies are known fuck ups. They fucking suck at everything, even making cars. Hopefully they invest enough to build something meaningful on top of IVY.

Position: 300 shares, various calls.

Buying more shares on Monday. probably $10-15K total.

**TLDR:** GME🚀 bears r fuk

🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎  🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎

**The questions you should be asking...**

People have left out all the fund traded shares that are owned (likely locked into place unless it moons and they have to rebalance). You're leaving out all the synthetic shares floating out around because of the shorts, and the facts the institutions or their allies are front running those shorts likely. Citron has also ignited a fight with some funds that have a bone to pick.

You're leaving out that the shorts also ARE NOT GETTING DELIVERED. Just because a broker has the shares on their books to short does NOT mean those shares are delivered.

How do I know? [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

GameStop's been on it far too long.

But brokers don't give a fuck, because SEC doesn't give enough of a fuck to do anything about it. They also don't give a FUCK about you. They only give a fuck with someone that matters enough does something wrong enough that someone else who matters enough gets hurt. Why did Elon get charged? There were a few institutions betting against it, remember?

&#x200B;

**Questions for you**

Have you checked institutional inflow estimates? Have you checked L2 aggregated orders? Have you peeked at the bulk order flows?

Do you actually have any idea how fucked the shorts are? Because if you did, you'd second mortgage your fucking house and put it on the line (do **NOT** do this you fucking idiot, it's a figure of speech).

&#x200B;

**General thesis as of today:**

* Institutions are fighting each other, not just us
* Enough people have enemies within Wall Street, they're willing to pad their bottom lines after a year like we've had if the risk is minimal and greater for the other side (because one side has to give in first, humans can only take so much punishment)
* Citron is obviously, blatantly manipulating the stock via the methods I describe below (note, today there were shares available to be loaned, and right before his stream, there was a massive short attack and then VIOLA there were no more shares to borrow. I don't know if this is coordinated with institutions, but the fuckers only worth $5M, he doesn't have the money to do what is going on by himself. **It could easily be algorithms just picking up news** on the wire and inappropriately acting on it.
* Institutional inflows, bulk orders, and dark pools allow the type of wars we're watching (explained below)
* I think there's just general interest in the stock, the added upside is that Citron and Melvin get fucked in the process of us owning a revolutionary gaming company
* Cohen is going to change things, and hopefully he goes on Benzinga tomorrow to give commentary

🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎  🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎

&#x200B;

**On how the volume is behaving and what is going on likely:**

As far as institutional inflows those and bulk order flows sometimes go together. Also, some dark pools aggregate their orders so what looks like a bunch of 1000, 500, 250, 50, 90, 110 share lots when people are selling are actually a single lot of 2000 etc.

These dark pools are used as back channels for some private funds that have broker access to the street, and help to disguise institutional movements mostly for hedge funds and speculative funds.

By looking at inflow estimate reports (you have to be in the industry to get access to most of this, it comes from extremely expensive research firms that brokers pay, or they have a team in house doing it) along with bulk orders, and trying to match those to the T&S tape ticker, you can start to see perhaps who is moving what.

If someone transacts let's say, 1M shares, and you can attribute it to a single individual somehow (if the pool didn't aggregate their order into another order to mix it into the execution cycle which normally they do to try and hide it) you can get an idea of what the true tradeable float is (if you don't get why, it's because you don't buy a million shares of something to day trade it, those are sitting at home for awhile, a long while).

Those institutions buying those shares will let the price fall, then throw 50-100k of their shares through. You don't just execute a buy or sell of 1M shares @ $40, it's a thousand here, thousand there and the algo tries to get you the best price possible. Often you'll see dips, massive buy spikes, then buy/sell walls go up at price points where their average is to try and build a retail base also. Considering originally there was a low percentage of outstanding shares traded per day, building that base will take time because institutional ownership is so huge. Once that is built, they just have to counter act any shorts, and see even 50 basis point increase in volume could set this entire thing off.

Those short attacks will stop once the shorts get out of their position but the base will remain and the hunger for the shares will remain. If the short float falls a bit, it actually will help us believe it or not, because the people that are going to get fucked here aren't the institutional traders - it's the big retail whales and 9 figure individuals betting against this. The big firms are already hedged, I promise you.

With the short volume being met by institutional buying volume, I estimate the actual float to be much, much, much smaller than the numbers we're seeing. Institutional ownership is over 100% -- this is ONLY possible by buying synthetic shares that are shorted.

All of this combined shows me that we have firms going at each other. A couple retail whales come in and upset that balance of power, and we're going to see this thing rip upwards. What you're likely seeing is firms day trading calls on swings (yes, calls, not puts) and forcing those swings to help them profit some, then cover some of their shares and slowly reduce the delta of their positions. They're not trading puts because that just exaggerates their delta, they trade the calls in case the thing fucking flies to the moon, their losses are capped as it sits now, and they're likely trading portions of their share position. 10% at a time, and if they have enough capital, they can drag this fight out for a long fucking time. There's no benefit for them to unwind all at once, it could set this thing into the stratosphere. It's potentially possible many of them have various dated $20 calls to help cover their short (and by possible, I mean likely, because the algos probably hedged as soon as it saw the price/volume explode when it moved off the $20 mark and identified the possible buttfucking their short position was about to give them) and they're just slamming volume around trying to create volatility because that's the best for the people writing the options (them and their friends). For all we know, some of these shorts are completely hedged just building it up to profit off the squeeze. If the shares rip up once they get out of the position, they don't care, because they'll hold to expiration for hedge, exercise, take the gains, and tank the stock again and short it on the way down while hedging the upside again. If the stock goes down, they can dump the calls and just let their short ride back down a ways. The calls are their cap -- similar to people buying a debit spread instead of long calls.

But with Melvin's puts likely expired and not re-upped in any identifiable way, that means we know one guy is really under the heat and already way fucking down on his position, which causes desperation. Humans can only take so much. Match that up with Citron's extreme fucking failures over the course of the last two years, we got a couple guys with reputations and millions on the line.

* **When is the short squeeze going to happen?**

I have no idea when. Whenever the institutions are happy with their positions, probably.

Days to cover means shit, for every person that covers, at this point, someone else is going to take their spot because enough firms think that it's going down and they would love that because they want a better entry on the long term. Believe it or not, regardless of Credit Suisse's way off price target, there's numerous VC firms and big whales looking at this right now wondering if WSB got something right, and if they understand the industry better. Most these guys don't understand gaming, it's a new, growing industry.

The catch is that someone has to be the first one to jump, like cliff diving into water you don't know the depth of. If one firm jumps, others may join. But if they jump and are wrong, they're tied into that investment and can't be non-directional if they're making an investment based play since that would be bad to suppress price for the company they're invested in and a violation of fiduciary responsibility.

This is part of the reason that long term, we could benefit from a pullback. Let some of the assholes off the hook so the real price can be determined by the market.

* **Meta: How do I learn to be good at trading?**

Learn the market first, learn how to trade without any of the finance knowledge. This knowledge really doesn't help me trade all that much, it helps me understand why I win or lose, but knowing how to pick entries/exits and how to control my emotions is the best thing I've learned although I'm unhinged on Melvin and Citron

How I Made $2M In The Stock Market by Nicholas Darvas, then review Bill O Neill's shit with a grain of salt, don't follow CANSLIM to the T, but some of the ideas are sound like how to identify growth companies.

After that, mess around trading shares and just make a goal to profit. If you're down, analyze the position and thesis and decide if you will get a profitable spot later, if so, learn discipline and hold. If not, cut it loose and start another trade.

Do it about 50,000 times over 10,000 hours and you'll get good at it.

&#x200B;

***In Conclusion:*** If you're in the industry, you have access to shit others don't (not implying I am, or how I know these things). You should be able to watch a price/volume chart during the day and instantly identify institutional activity.

Fuck Melvin and Fuck Andrew Left and Shitron. It's one thing to be in a firm and short a stock for fundamental reasons. It's a whole other thing to let your ego get in the way after you drove the price down to $3 and go for the jugular just to make yourself feel better. The guy deserves the fucking $200-$300M loss he's about to eat at the current price, probably more considering the options he had expired and he's likely got some other hedges in place that won't work out for him.

This isn't to flex knowledge, it's to tell people you should be careful just spreading info around this board and getting people on board with a thesis. We're all mostly right on the idea that there's a squeeze coming, but it isn't for the reasons that we're saying.

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

**TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.**

Articles have started to trickle down on Reddit and other social media platforms trying to explain how this is a bad idea and justify the actions of Robinhood and other brokerage firms.

GME,l6py0p,2021-01-28 07:23:53,GME Wars: Suits Strike Back. WARNING FOR ALL YOU FELLOW AUTISTS,"Obligatory I’m not a financial advisor this is not blah blah blah.

Okay GME gang. We’ve got the shorts on the ropes. They’re bleeding hard and all the billionaire suits are shitting themselves out of fear. They’ve tried false information, getting on CNBC and screaming for regulation of our “market manipulation,” trying to get us shut down, Biden administration tweet, saying shorts have already covered, etc. None of it has worked so far and they’re still bleeding money.

Now they’re truly desperate. What’s something they haven’t tried quite yet but very well could be setting up to do?

MARKET CRASH

Yes, that’s right. I believe with what I’m currently seeing, they are going to crash the market and blame it on us. Do I think you need to be concerned about GME? No, because holding it should still work and they still have to cover anyway, but this is definitely to try to get you scared and sell GME and so they can take your money back when you reinvest elsewhere.

I don’t think I have to tell many of you that the current levels are at/above where the market was valued in 2008 before the crash according to the Buffet indicator. All this says is that we’re probably in a market bubble, and it’s been at these levels for months now. But guess what just started getting talked about by all the suits? That’s right. A bubble. And who are they blaming? Us.

Now that I have your attention, let’s look at a few other things.

[This is the Volatility Index the past week.](https://imgur.com/gallery/C9ETmMR) Notice how it’s been steadily rising and suddenly spiked today? 40 is typically the resistance before the market makes a downturn. If this thing gets above that we’ll probably be seeing the market dropping quickly.

Additionally, there the spurts of high volume absolutely dumping stocks for short amounts of time. That’s one of the first things I noticed before the March crash and I’ve been seeing it get more and more abundant the last few weeks and picking up a lot today. [Notice the large red volume candles on the weekly SPY chart.](https://imgur.com/a/w0y33Lq) (Robinhood screenshot on a DD post??? Yes, I know. I’m on my phone with limited time. Deal with it lol.)

Now you might say, “it’s earnings season and there have been some bad earnings so far and that’s expected in this tough time.” Well yes, but there’s the Apple earnings today. They beat earnings pretty nicely and what did the stock do? [You guessed it (I hope).](https://imgur.com/a/Txc7po6)

Currently we’re seeing fundamentally strong companies as well as the S&P 500 beginning to drop and the volatility increase market wide. You could say this is “smart money” pulling out because they see the overvalued stocks. However, there were many worldwide financial issues sparking before the March crash. It just needed a catalyst, AKA global pandemic. Now we’re in a similar boat. Market issues in need of a catalyst.

What is that catalyst this time around? That’s right. A bunch of “millennials on a message board who have no place in stocks creating a market bubble.” Basically this isn’t smart money pulling out here. It’s MAD MONEY (hi Cramer). They are declaring WAR. They are pissed that we are “stealing” their billions on billions of dollars from them and they will do whatever it takes to get you to sell and take your money away from you again, including wrecking the market and the economy once again. The suits are out for blood now.

Do I think this will effect GME much? Only if you don’t sell. All this is scare tactics and ways to win your money back if keeping GME suppressed fails even more than it already has. There are hardly any shares to short if any at all and retail investors and autists are likely the ones holding most of the shares that could be sold.

Be careful out there autists

TLDR: GME TO VALHALLA. Rest of the market, potentially to the depths of Avernus soon.

GME,l4x5mu,2021-01-25 21:48:12,GME price action,"TLDR: Very bullish price action today. SPY violent drop halted the bullish momentum. Short attack at noon failed to reverse sentiment. Expect more volatility during the week. This is my own interpretation of the price action today and is not financial advice. Honestly, I'm a moron with an IQ below 69. I don't have a PT. I let the market tell me that.

&#x200B;

[1min intraday chart of GME \(candles\) and SPY \(blue line\)](https://preview.redd.it/8osyp4jqdjd61.png?width=2433&format=png&auto=webp&s=49125a85d34b59adcd3376812a22ddd25b5cbbb9)

&#x200B;

Very strong pre-market activity opening with a 2.5M shares sold to force price below 95.  [Read this post to understand why this 95 level matters. Absolutely on point during today's action.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4207e/gme_options_pricing_expected_and_max_volatility/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) MM needed to defend this price level or hedge above it. At this point in time, for 1/29, there were 25.000 puts ITM and +25.000 calls OTM between 95 - 115. Once the 95 level broke, it was a gamma event like last friday only this time, price shoot-up above the highest strike and all the way to $160. Notice the deceleration after 115 (highest strike) which could mean that MM were completing their hedges. After, I believe we started seeing short covering and margin calls. 22M shares traded hands within 20 minutes as price shoots from 115 to 160 and with $10 dollar bid-ask spreads.   


But then, trading halted and SPY took a violent dive bringing down all equities across the board. Algo trading kicked-in and GME lost 50% in less than 30min. However, unlike the previous increase, less than 10M shares traded hands in that period. Notice how OBV reacted with both moves.

The MM gamma event lost momentum and at exactly noon, when liquidity tends to dry, a big short attack to drive price down to the previous open, only to be countered by some big money purchases to where it currently stands (and likely will close).

&#x200B;

My take on all this is that the tape is showing accumulation at current prices. OI in OTM calls and puts is now close to 200.000 contracts (say actually 15M shares - or half the current float to hedge) for 1/29 alone. Gamma events are not over and if today is any indication, it seems like MMs are more active hedging then last week. With a gap-up at open it should be similar price action.

GME,l528pz,2021-01-26 01:52:36,GME EndGame part 3: A new opponent enters the ring,"Wow - what a week. This is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven’t read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true.

# Previous Important Posts

* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven’t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close
* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME.
* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading.

# What’s happened thus far

## Why did GME go up on Friday?

The story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe. GME has been driven up by 3 different forces:

* Organic buying
   * There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world (not just WSB) about GME’s future
   * There’s been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside (for example, see gmedd.com)
   * The Citron Backfire
      * Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary’s. They went to Citron and [coordinated a dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) to try to bring the price down.
      * However, this backfired. Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left’s pleas. Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air, **minutes after he left** [they bought shares live on their show](https://youtu.be/mFiFWBrE5DE?t=5104)**.**
      * The next day, our very on u/Uberkikz11 [was on Benzinga](https://youtu.be/GLzTU87MJMM?t=837) and more shares were bought.
   * Larger investors piling in
      * In my [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/), I hypothesized that we’d soon see larger investors pile in. Then, on WSB, we saw posts from a [venture capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) as well as a [hedge fund investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)
* Gamma squeeze
   * Once the organic buying started, we rolled into a gamma squeeze. Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won’t repeat, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for an example.
* Ultra low liquidity - In EndGame part 1, I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float, and **share availability has been reducing** driven by lots of diamond hands, not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too.
* I believe there were some short covers on Friday, but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod.

However, not many people have talked about why it **went down**

## Why did GME come down?

Here’s where things got interesting for me, and something I think happened again today (Monday) when GME climbed up over 100% but then had a rapid reversal, closing 20% above yesterday but closing below open.

So Friday looked like a slam dunk - gamma squeeze, no shorts available to short, puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic. What happened?

This is my fan fiction, based on what I saw.

**I believe** [**market-makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) **took a non-neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt.**

Market-makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market, but they also have abilities that others don’t - for example they are legally allowed to naked short for “liquidity purposes”. They also have the ability to halt trading.

There were two halts in the day on Friday: First, when GME was up 69% (heh heh), and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed. Note that at the time of the first halt, the **bid-ask spread was $10 on the underlying** a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy.

However, after the second halt, something strange happened. Whereas a few minutes prior, there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below $75, **within 15 minutes** after the halt there were sellers at 70, 65, 60, and 56. Where did these sellers come from?

&#x200B;

[Incredible momentum reversal on Friday 1\/22 to push the price not too far above the 60c strike price. ](https://preview.redd.it/tt5zodp6pkd61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa22980543213227bf5b3d17166129ac6cb65a65)

My speculation? This was a coordinated **naked short ladder attack**. In this type of attack, short seller A sells to short seller B, who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price, etc. and with a **very small amount of capital** you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits.

Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.

All this led me to believe that the **real fair market price for GME was above $65.** Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher.

## A repeat on Monday

The short ladder attack repeated on Monday.

GME opened strong above $90, and quickly climbed to **a high above $155** before it was halted, immediately after the halt, a **short ladder attack again** drove the price down

&#x200B;

[Dejavu - Incredible Momentum Reversal after trading halts. ](https://preview.redd.it/qm81rd0dpkd61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4563e7dd2e626fb09dca69668c24631932e707)

Both days, there **were rapid and significant reversals in momentum.**

Now, I kept wondering - why would MM’s take the side of the shorts? What’s in it for them? One theory was that they were not adequately hedged, with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to.

But then the news hit today:

# A new opponent enters the ring:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8htb0scgpkd61.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=228a8a84e592ea4642a61c5e07e07ae344ac8f2c

That’s right, the **same Citadel** [**listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) is now invested in Melvin’s hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME’s share price.

**Hey media - you want a manipulation story? You’re missing the big one.**

# Now what?

Shorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they’ve been pushed to the edge. Paid media attacks, Citron’s fluff tweet + coordinated shorting, and now they’ve got the **actual people who get all the order flow on their side.**

On the other hand, GME is still up over 20% and now trading at $88.00 after hours, which is well above the previous day’s high.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rr5qet4ipkd61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28bf446a714906712503726f5903a681d5368

What this tells me is that GME’s **true price is still being suppressed**. They are using every tactic possible, even changing the [bid-ask spread rules](https://thefly.com/permalinks/entry.php/id3233043/GME;IRBT-NYSE-changes-bidask-differentials-on-options-for-GameStop-iRobot) on options to specifically target retail’s buying of options.

We’re now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game.

Some shorts may have covered today - with prices below $60 at one point they had some great opportunities to. However, there is **no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today.**

The short position still lost 20% from yesterday. They’ve got more fingers in the dam, but it’s definitely cracking. Also, **every call option purchased prior to 1/25 is ITM and profitable,** while **every put option purchased prior to 1/25 is OTM.**

And, for some reason, the SEC still doesn’t want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME, where it’s now **been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered “short squeeze”.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rbrf6khjpkd61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e4f432ff02dbf475a03cc68c54a5a0f5f0de429

# Margin impacts:

Note that at this point, most brokers have increased margin on GME. This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions.

This also means **puts will get more expensive** as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100% of the notional in their accounts to secure the put, so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand.

That means it’s not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you’re aiming for the long-term and not the squeeze, but keep in mind you’ll need the exact same capital as if you’d bought the shares, so it’s up to you on this.

For shorts, a margin increase while the price is moving against you (even with retracements) is no good.

# My speculation

* Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run. It’s possible they can’t say anything at all during the pre-earnings quiet period, but I’m sure they can see what’s happening.
* MMs will continue to play dirty, but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1/29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry.

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. I've been in GME for a few months but I've seen almost every trick in the book. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here’s some things to be careful about.

* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don’t mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that’s net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage.
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn’t sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up.
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I’m not specifically going to share them here because I don’t want to give the ideas circulation, but
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don’t copy others and don’t try to be memey. Make your own decisions.
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it’s an **attack vector** for you.
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn’t resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you’re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration.
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you’d be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you’ll get to margin call faster.
* **Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I’ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I’ve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility.
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you’ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I’m holding over $1M in shares and calls.

# 1/26 Update

Hi everyone. Sorry for not posting or replying to comments. I was auto-banned from WSB when this post was auto-deleted by the auto-mod. Thanks to u/zjz to reversing the auto-deletion of the post though as it looked like it was helpful to the community.  

Hope you all made a ton of money today!

**Quick Notes:**

* At an after-hours price of **$209 a share**, **every call option, for every expiry, for every strike price is in-the-money. This is the third time this has happened for GME recently.** Amazing. What this means now is that market makers will need to buy a lot of shares to hedge for the calls expiring this week. Heed my above warnings. 
* At this price, shorts **will start to get liquidated.** Combining the 400% weekly gain with the margin requirements increasing across the board, brokers will force close short positions. Starting maybe with the small guys, but it will cause a ripple effect. **Things could move fast.** Some funds may get additional bailouts this week to hold out. 
* **You need to decide your own exit.** Only you know how much $ you're playing with, how much you're willing to lose, how important the $ is to you, etc. **Minimize you're regret, don't maximize your profits.** If you are thinking about taking profits this week, spread out your sells so you don't kick yourself over timing things poorly. Personally, I think we are in **unprecedented territory** and that there's no way all of the shorts have exited already, so we're not done. I could be wrong. See EndGame part 1. 
* **Close spreads.** With every call ITM, you are at the risk of early-assignment. If you don't watch closely, you could be hit with sky-high hard-to-borrow fees and get killed on what you thought was a profitable trade. 
* **Watch for ripple effects. This is already happening.** When funds get liquidated, they have to buy back all their other shorts (see AMC, BBBY) and sell their longs (look at BABA after-hours). Want to play GME without playing GME? Maybe throw a little $ at BBBY. You do you. 
* In EndGame Part 2, I talked about potential investors, and how the higher price is gonna attract the bigger $. Today we saw Chamath, Winklevoss, and others. And then Elon tweeted and simultaneously stimulated the buying frenzy and scared the crap out of shorts. I'm just gonna copy what I said about this potentiality
   * ***Elon****: (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar?* ***Elon’s wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** *Elon could* ***buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours****. One call from fellow entrepreneur and* [*aspiring twitter-meme-god*](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) *would absolutely wreck the game.*

1. ***If you are short gamestop****, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. ""Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it."" 🚀*

Just remember that when DFV was buying $GME at prices as low as $4 per share he wasn't signing up for the 'diamond hands never sell' club and he never got into the play for reasons like smashing hedge funds, curing cancer etc. That stuff has all come about from us and people jumping on the bandwagon.

WSB before this crazy week that has changed the sub forever was all about taking on risk to try and make money fast. DFV has achieved that on a scale we haven't seen before and if he decides to take profits we should support him doing so and not get upset that it may affect the price etc or say he betrayed a cause he never signed up for.

**There is no way the real short interest percentage is 53% but even if it is, THATS STILL HIGH AF!** You think these greedy HF's are just going to cover and then leave the stock alone? Right now they think they have you on the ropes so they're tripling down and shorting this shit on the way down! You know what that means? They're shorting it at $115 instead of $450 which is WAYYY more risky. It's super easy to justify $115 fundamentally for GME without even taking into consideration the squeeze.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**We're in a desert right now and the HF's are dying of thirst and we have the water.** Are you going to sell it them at a loss for peanut? Fuck no!

**Buy low, sell high!** Do you have cash in your account? Buy low? When you're buying you should probably feel a little hesitant, that's how you know you're getting a good deal! Holding shares? Don't sell! You're supposed to sell high not sell low you dumb fuck.

GME,l2iczw,2021-01-22 08:04:49,GME DD: Float breakdown + MOASS speculations," This is a somewhat long read. Let’s start with the summary.

# Tldr;

* VW-like MOASS is likely to happen regardless of whether we 💎hand or not; and whether we keep stocks in cash vs margin. Pussy 🧻🖐are not going to make the squeeze any weaker but rather they will just miss out on the best part.
* The true float is not enough to cover all shorts. (not new, but detailed holding breakdown below)
* The most violent part of the squeeze is likely to happen on the last 1-2 days of the squeeze, not the beginning. 
* The end (peak) of the squeeze is not in our hands as much as it is in the hands of large institutional holders, insiders or a company offering.
* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Disclaimer**: I’m a simple retard trying to understand the mechanics of the market. This is not advice on what to do. If you have input your feedback is welcome.

# Float deep dive

Previous DDs suggested that the violence of the squeeze depends on the ratio between shorted shares and available shares they can buy to cover. 

I wanted to understand exactly what this ratio is like right now and going into the squeeze. The purpose of this exercise for me was to gather data available on all holdings (institutions, insiders and mutual funds) to find out exactly how much float there is.

## True float 

Before looking at the data, let’s talk about float vs true float. True float is a word I came up with to help myself understand how many shares are available for shorters to purchase.

As mentioned in previous DDs, each 1 share sold short creates another synthetic long share. This explains why the total shares in the market are larger than the number of shares issued by the company.

Thus, the true float = share float + synthetic longs from each short

= share float + short interest = \~117M

Now, let’s take a look at how much of that true float is available to trade. I’ve compiled this sheet below to break down the holdings of insiders, mutual funds and institutional holdings. Note that this doesn’t account for WSB holdings.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gg7lm3zj1uc61.png?width=3356&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8c77a8a0b8e8cecef2ad754a04029d302fc52e3

 

## Observations

* Insiders and institutional holdings alone account for more than 100% of the company issued shares. 
   * In other words, the shorts simply cannot cover their shorts from the market alone. 
   * This is what previous DD’s referred to as negative float.
*  The share/float ratio currently is roughly 2.3:1

# Why I don’t think holding in cash vs margin makes much of a difference

The premise from previous DD’s is that holding in cash accounts and not margin means shorters can no longer borrow the stocks to short further. This is absolutely correct. 

Essentially, my understanding is shorters can borrow any share from the “true float”  (including synthetic longs) to short sell it again. They can just keep shorting the stock forever pretty much if they have infinite money.

Eventually, some of those synthetic longs created by shorting will arrive in a 💎hand cash account, which reduces the amount of borrowable shares from the true float.

Thus, available to short for shorters= True float - cash account 💎hand shares.

When the shares available to short are reduced, they become hard to borrow and brokers raise borrow rates on them. This makes shorters bleed faster.

While I agree that holding in cash account makes shorters bleed faster, I don’t think it makes a difference in the eventual occurrence of the squeeze because:

1. Shorters don’t have infinite money to keep shorting it forever. 
2. I’d expect brokers would raise borrow rates regardless of borrow availability since shorting a fast climbing stock has a high risk and the stock is climbing very fast.
3. It’s obvious that the sentiment is shifting very positively in the favor of GME. Anyone trying to short it further at this point is playing with fire and risking bankruptcy.
4. Once the squeeze starts, it should get very violent. Shorting this stock during it’s squeeze sounds like suicide so I’m speculating no new shorts will be open during the squeeze until news of an offering or something comes out.

In other words, buying on margin seems equally good to me if you’re considering it. But if you can keep your shares in cash, go for it as it may bleed the shorters sooner rather than later.

# Why I think VW-like MOASS is still likely to happen even though the current short:float ratio is not like VW

The short:float ratio is not constant.

Since insiders, institutions and mutual funds hold over 100% of the float, it seems to be the case that the entirety of our shares are synthetic longs created due to shorts.

As shorts cover, synthetic long shares disappear from the market. As the true float grows smaller, the ratio between the remaining shorts needed to cover and the remaining float will change.

To imagine this, I created a chart to try to visualize what happens to the short/float ratio during the squeeze for different possibilities of days to cover.

Since it’s hard for me to predict how many shorts will cover exactly each day, I made some basic assumptions:

* Let’s assume that for D days to cover, each day will see (SI / D) shorts covered. In other words, the shorts will be covered evenly over the days to cover.
   * This probably isn’t very accurate. In reality I expect the shorts covered to start small then increase dramatically each day due to margin calls.
   * If anything, I’d imagine this means reality should be more violent than this chart.
* Let’s assume insiders and institutions will sell 20% of their holdings prior to or during the squeeze
   * 20% makes it more of a worst case scenario.
   * I see how it makes sense to think that insiders and institutional holders would want to take advantage of the situation and sell more.
   * However, if those people have anything close to even a fresh grad intern working on this, they should understand that by holding longer they are creating fortunes for themselves.
* Let’s assume no new short positions will be opened during the squeeze
   * This seems straightforward. Can you imagine someone shorting VW during its squeeze? They would be out of their mind. 
   * Even if someone is that crazy, I’d expect brokers would have skyrocketing fees.

Following the above assumptions, I created the following tables. Each table represents the outstanding SI, the available to trade float, and short:available ratio respectively.

To visualize the data above, let’s put it on a chart. Y axis is short:float ratio.

&#x200B;

 

Observations

1. The short:float ratio becomes somewhat exponential as time passes due to supply shortage.
   1. NOTE: It looks like the lines end early at small values. Don't fret, this simply means there are no shares available anymore after this day, aka the line tends to infinity.
2. The squeeze becomes way more violent, more violent than VW, on later days (especially past 2-3 days) for all of different hypothetical values of days to cover.
3. In all scenarios, there will become a point at which there are simply no shares available (negative) for short positions to purchase to cover.

Point (3) here is what makes this squeeze an infinity squeeze like a previous DD called it. Essentially, at this point remaining short positions are at the mercy of insiders, institutions, mutual funds or a company offering. Heck, even the offering of $100M may not be enough shares to cover the remaining short positions when the price skyrockets.

I’m just a retard trying to wrap my head around this to arrive at this observation. However it’s safe to assume all of the above entities should be completely aware of this situation and the possibility of an infinity squeeze. I don’t see why they wouldn’t want to take advantage of this situation to name their price. Institutions could sell out and make deals with Melvin and shorters but they would be acting against their self interest; I'm assuming they can just get paid by brokers even if Melvin et al. go bankrupt.

My conclusion - 

The infinity squeeze is somewhat inevitable. It may likely start small. Once it starts, it will keep getting more violent each day. If shorts start covering and the stock skyrockets, chances are it will skyrocket aggressively further each day for the next 2-3 days until institutional holdings sell or the company announces an offering which seem unlikely to start early.

Positions: \~8,000 shares, no limit orders set. Company fair value in my book is >$100 without a squeeze.

ALL,laccqy,2021-02-01 20:54:27,"WHY YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE FALL FOR ALL THE SILVER SCAMS!!! CAREFUL, YOU ARE BEING PLAYED BY THE MOST POWERFUL ELITE ON THE PLANET!!!","# THIS IS A META THREAD IN WHICH I'M JUST DOING 2 THINGS: RANTING AND LINKING TO OTHER DD THREADS THAT PREDATE GME MOONING BY MONTHS, THUS CALLING BULLSHIT ON THE 6 MILLION NEW DEGENERATES THAT ""HAVE NEVER SEEN A SLV JPM SQUEEZE IDEA IN THIS SUB BEFORE THE SUITS WANTED TO SAVE MELVIN"".

Do you realize reddit has a search function? Here is a list of posts that talk about a potential silver squeeze of SLV and JPM long, long, long before GME blasted off towards the moon. This is /r/wallstreetbets, not /r/GME. We trade multiple tickers, you dumbshit fucking ""entry at $450"" bag holding tards.

Great, you joined in the last 2 weeks because your autistic nephew made more money in 2 months than you've ever done.

Instead of just shutting up and watching the plethora of good DD posts rise and fall, you think this entire subreddit is only about holding one frickin' short squeeze as if that's the first time in history anyone got squoze, and downvote otherwise great research because you're frickin' terrified of losing money you couldn't afford to lose in the first place.

The entire global media didn't all pool together in 48 hours to present a uniform story of ""buy silver"" as part of some frickin' conspiracy designed to save a few medium-sized American hedge funds. No more than COVID was made by the Chinese to win Biden the presidency, anyway.

So here, since you guys are too damn handicapped to use a fucking search engine, are a list of DD/YOLO/Discussion posts about SLV and Silver written LONG BEFORE THE FUCKING GME SHORT SQUEEZE FINALLY ROCKETED!!! Jesus fuck, you tinfoil wearing sack of ""fake news"" American mouth-breathers with the collective IQ of a doorknob.

Just look at the fucking DD and pretend GME doesn't exist for 5 minutes. Silver. Is. A. Deep. Fucking. Value. Play! It has value. So much fucking deep value! 

Yeah, no shit a market maker is holding silver positions when silver becomes more sought after, their job is to make fucking markets liquid. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY IF YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT TO SUPPLY?! DID YOU NOTICE HOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF PUTS AND A LOT OF CALLS, AND NOT JUST CALLS?!

DO YOU THINK NO BILLIONAIRES HELPED RIDE GME UP? Do you think it was 100% retail on one side and 100% Melvin and Citron on the other? Ah, you do. Of course, you do.  


GREAT, WE GOT 8 MILLION DEGENERATES HERE. The 6M that didn't manage to find this place without hearing about GME having rocketed already, MAYBE DON'T FUCKING POST, COMMENT AND BRING YOUR DAMN IGNORANCE INTO A SUB THAT WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDING 2-10 DECENT TRADE IDEAS PER WEEK PRIOR TO THIS CULT FUCKING INFESTATION OF JACKASSES COSPLAYING RETARDS.

Whatever, here's a list none of you fuckers are capable of reading:

\- 5 months ago, /u/negovany wrote ""[Cornering Silver Market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/idjk61/cornering_silver_market/)"". The whole thing is about JPM and squeezing silver. $GME was at $5 back then and /u/DeepFuckingValue was still getting laughed at for buying at every opportunity. Rest of you fuckers had barely gotten over the last cult following, PRPL mattresses.  
\- 6 months ago, /u/lucasandrew talks about ""[Why you should trade futures - WSB Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3qkex/why_you_should_trade_futures_wsb_edition/)"", in which he mentions ""*Speaking of SLV, people have been posting all the reasons that JPM fucks with the SLV ETF*"". Yeah, I bet he took a fucking time-machine back 6 months in time after Citadel got stuck in the boo-boo. 

\- 6 months ago, /u/LE0TARD0 implores the ""[SILVER CHAD'S RISE UP!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy7nvn/silver_chads_rise_up/)"". A straight fundamental thread on why silver is undervalued, not mention JPM. However, in the comments, a thread is started by /u/kbtech18 and supplemented by /u/ayyayyron talking about precisely JPM and their price manipulation of silver. YEAH, NO THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I'M SORRY FOR BEING A SHILL, LIKE FUCKING TAKE YOUR TINFOIL HATS OFF YOU DUMB SHITS!

\- 5 months ago, /u/Fuzzers wrote ""[September Silver Futures Contact - Something Aint Right Kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9b1th/september_silver_futures_contact_something_aint/)"".  
After hailing his fellow degenerates, HE IMMEDIATELY SAYS: ""*I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver,""* before later writing ""*A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts."".* Isn't IT JUST GLORIOUS HOW MELVIN AND CITADEL HAVE ALL THESE TIME MACHINES TO MAKE UP IMAGINARY SILVER SQUEEZES 6 MONTHS BEFORE THEY WERE MADE UP? YOU GUYS ARE SO FUCKING DUMB RIGHT NOW, HOLY FUCK! DON'T INVEST IN SILVER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, BUT PLEASE STOP WITH THE AMERICAN FAKE NEWS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, IT HURTS MY ALREADY FUCKED UP BRAIN, STOP, I DON'T CONSENT!

\- 5 months ago (YOU GUYS, MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT, ALL THE POSTS ARE FROM 5-6 MONTHS AGO, MAYBE IT REALLY IS A TIME TRAVELLING CONSPIRACY BY MELVIN AND CITADEL, YES, LET'S GO WITH THAT!), /u/jetter23, wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6l0o2/weekend_update_silver/)"". What did he have to share, in terms of ideas and DD? "" *4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short,*  "". WHAT SNEAKY FRICKIN' MARKET MANIPULATING HEDGE FUND SHILL HE IS, JUST GOING BACK SO FAR IN TIME TO SET US UP FOR THE PERFECT TRAP TO HELP CITADEL!!!

\- /u/jetter23 was quite active shilling 5 months ago, he also wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver (DD#3)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9uxok/weekend_update_silver_dd3/)"", where he just casually mentioned ""*JPM is currently under DOJ investigation AGAIN for price speculation on Silver. JPM is learning a VERY expensive lesson that when there is a pandemic, global FIAT currencies are crashing(like the DXY), and there is a run on physical metals - you can't be naked short on paper.""* IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF SILVER SHORT SQUEEZE ON JPM, BUT HEY, THAT CAN'T BE IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A SCAM FAKE NEWS IDEA THAT'S 2-3 DAYS OLD, RIGHT? 

\- /u/CCJ_Moon_6969 popped his head into the stream of tachyons, relatively talking to us from the present all the way 6 months ago, when he wrote ""[Silver. $SLV call options. New York Comex.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy8wv9/silver_slv_call_options_new_york_comex/)"". Do you remember /u/kbtech18 from a few threads up? WELL, GEE WHIZ, HE COVERED THAT TIME STREAM TOO, talking about JPM and silver. 6 months ago. I mean, today. Reddit probably changed the timestamps on the posts. DAMN SHILLS!  
\- /u/rawvi wrote ""[JPM and Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i88cyy/jpm_and_silver/)"" 5 months ago, wanting to learn more about... time travel. Nothing to do with naked shorting of silver. BECAUSE THAT WASN'T EVER TALKED ABOUT ON THIS UNTIL 2 DAYS AGO, SO LIKE... HAH, HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ASKING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?!?!

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They’re running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They’re just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there’s a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that’s why they’re playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That’s why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won’t be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what’s SCARING wallstreet.

GME,lasuet,2021-02-02 11:40:31,How to Win GME,"This week, we have experienced blatant market manipulation from the other side. They have spread misdirection via fake stories from corrupt reporters. They have used computer algorithms that buy and sell from each other to drive the price down. Monday's exact -100 result was a giant FU to us, telling us they control the price.

However, we have the power of numbers and we have the power of public sentiment. We are fighting an honorable battle against an EVIL foe. We are on the side of good, and there is a very simple strategy that we can use to win.

**Go to a cash account**. If EVERYONE with a brokerage account, even people who don't own GME stock, contacted their broker and turned their account into a CASH account, that will stop our brokers from lending our shares to hedge funds to use to short stocks. If EVERYONE did this, all lent out shares would be called back and hedge funds would have to close their short positions by BUYING shares. They will have to buy shares all across the market and those stocks will go up in price. They will have to sell some long shares in order to come up with capital to close their shorts, but overall the market should be neutral.

We don't control fake news. We don't manipulate stocks. We just like stocks and like talking about them. Our strength is in our solidarity and we have the support of the people. If we can make this into a movement and ask people to stop using margin and turn their accounts into CASH accounts in solidarity with us, we will win. Also, it will PISS them off because they can't cheat their way around it.

CASH ACCOUNT FTW.

$BB is very similar to $GME as it is a company that was huge in its time, currently is falling apart, but has a potentially bright future.

**""What volatility?"" I'm sure you're asking.**

THE ONE COMING FROM THE SQUEEZE. They are mega fucked. Today only around 1.5% of float GME remains. There is sufficient real research on this sub that shows that we are ACTUALLY diamond handing.

THAT 1.5% WILL GET GOBBLED UP IN NO TIME WITH OUR RETARDED GME BUYING.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb9s3f/bloomberg\_terminal\_looks\_mostly\_green/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb9s3f/bloomberg_terminal_looks_mostly_green/) (SEE LOCKED IN SHARES TOP LEFT RETARDS)

**On another note, some people's sell limit at 3.2k and 5k got filled today for 1 single GME share on this sub.**

&#x200B;

**Thesis:**

Goldman Sachs and the big boys have deleveraged their stake in GME and said they are reducing risk while also calling what already happened as the squeeze and that other hedges deleveraged as well. I can't tell if this is FUD or if they truly believe this. This info is in their daily customer subscription mailers, only actual GS customers get these mailers afaik. I don't know what is the truth anymore.

If Yellen wants to meet for volatility on a fizzling stock that is 98.4% ish locked in by buyers, this screams all kinds of alarms in my head. They are either going to try and stop the party or they are looking for money to pay us and not crash everything at the same time.

Tomorrow is the final fight. Yellen and all the bigwigs are the bosses.

Also i think it makes sense for the squeeze to happen this week before Friday due to the naked short puts the HFTs have been selling that are likely 2/05 of expiry. They DO NOT want this squeeze to happen next week when all those shorts are gone and the price is back way up. They also don't want the squeeze to happen on Friday due to the extreme volatility due to their naked 2/05 puts.

If all that makes sense, this means that the squeeze is coming tomorrow or the day after and NOT next week or this Friday.

If none of this happens, Cohen still has this smoking gun to trigger it.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbc6aa/cohen\_still\_has\_the\_opportunity\_to\_buy\_another\_7/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbc6aa/cohen_still_has_the_opportunity_to_buy_another_7/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

**Final words.**

* \-Set your sell limits.
* \-SET YOUR SELL LIMITS.
* \-YES YOU.
* \-FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS STRAIGHT.
* \-There's SOME consensus on the sub that realistically it should be \~800. Add a few lottos at 5k and 10k too as some people were lucky to get filled on 3.2k and 5k today. Don't get too greedy or you might not fill.

Basically, it seems like there is a ton of naked short selling going on and no one is doing anything about it. Thus, I propose a complaint campaign to get someone (cough, perhaps a government body who was designed to look into shit just like this, cough) to do something.

We can submit complaints here:

[https://www.sec.gov/tcr](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

There is literally an exact category for this (""Manipulation of a Security"" and then select ""Abusive Naked Short Selling"").

I'm a simpleton autist, I don't get fancy with my words but I've drafted a basic letter here that you can use:

*To whom it may concern,*

*This letter serves to bring the SEC’s attention to suspected illegal activity in GameStop Corporation’s (ticker GME) trading. As a shareholder in GME, I have concerns about illegal naked short selling and increasing failure-to-deliver rates in the month of December 2020 through present day. GME has consistently appeared on the NYSE Threshold Security list for the last 18 trading days. In order to appear on the threshold list, a stock has to have 0.05% of outstanding shares fail-to-deliver, for GameStop this amounts to roughly 350,000 shares.* ***GME’s failure to-delivery rates have exceed this amount on most trading days in December 2020***\*.\* ***Furthermore, on at least three trading days in December,*** ***the total number of shares failed-to-deliver exceeded 1 million***\*. Below is a summary of trading days in December which had exceptionally high failures-to-deliver:\*

*12/1: 91,971 @ $16.56*

*12/2: 1,061,397 @ $15.80*

*12/3: 1,787,191 @ $16.58*

*12/4: 999,475 @ $16.12*

*12/7: 1,002,379 @ $16.90*

*12/8: 872,292 @ $16.35*

*12/9: 721,361 @ $16.94*

*12/10: 605,975 @ $13.66*

*12/11: 880,063 @ $14.12*

*12/14: 284,296 @ $13.31*

*Given the data presented above, I request the SEC to further investigate suspected illegal naked short-selling in GME, particularly as it concerns Melvin Capital, who holds a substantial short position in the Company.*

Now as an autist, I don't even know if I've fully got the concept down but I think I'm close enough. Would love feedback if anyone with a big brain has any.

TLDR: Big money is playing illegal games on GME. We need to bring that shit to light

Edit: because there are some people doubting the legitimacy of the actual complaint here, I am posting some actual sources.

DD,lbg9oc,2021-02-03 06:11:07,$SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls) *VALUE PLAY* please read 😌,"9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, let’s look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME’s short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! 👀 Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger’s new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let’s hope he get’s it right with $SKT. 🙏🏾

FEB 25 PT: $55

TL;DR Blackberry/AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022. EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn't fucking matter. It 🚀 will 🚀 be 🚀 in 🚀 every 🚀 single 🚀 one 🚀 Oh, and Blackberry QNX Neutrinos RTOS is fun too.

Before you start reading, I'd suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.

You've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.

So why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*

**Zombie cars and QNX**

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

[SONY?](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGWdfOT_GLnUXiZBQr4m4lDr6V0nzG6pkRMU6WLRNhsLRKDJHY4MAwxHb-HWZr3pDmEfBYyleSgqSAIjoeXMqU6MfKVSgBbWY5t8brOzZ61dAfzBMOQezOwKfHLLecBdHNEqSjqSskM_c-uUKa-IndxUGWi_Ay9pQMD4kj0iDqvI) Blackberry QNX.

If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? [Li Auto](https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974) But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using [Nvidia](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform) DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Linux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.

That's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in ""Fate of the Furious"" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.

You know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.

The best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.

Now that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Blackberry x AWS IVY**

IVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That's right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen 👑👑👑

So what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.

IVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.

But you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.

Best part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.

For me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future.",DD,0.98

If you can't do that, go check out r/investing and leave your shriveled up raisin nuts on my desk as you head out. 

What do we all have in common? We are so fucking retarded that we can't even be reasoned with. Of all things to be afraid of, you guys are shitting your depends about a dude named Melvin. He might as well have been named Pubert because obviously his parents hate him. 

Who wins a war? A dude with a name as bad as Melvin, or a bunch of Wendy's fueled brainless retards chasing tendies with absolutely no concept of risk management? The answer is obviously us. We are so fucking stupid that nobody can calculate our moves. We are an unpredictable force. Instead of using TA or market sentiment, we just say ""hUrr DuRr StOnkS OnLy Go UP. Wow, I know 2 of those letters! All in for these FD's"" while we are pissing in a bottle and preparing to jerk off for the 8th time since breakfast. 

What we don't have in brains, we also don't have in capital. What we do have though, is something special. We are in a fight with somebody even stupider than us. They stand to lose more money than it would cost for your wife to be exclusive to you. 

Now for the final fucking time. Go change your diaper, prep for some ketchup on this tight bun and squeeze everything your absolutely retarded dimwit ass can find into GME shares. Stop getting cucked by Melvin and bitching about it left and right. We don't even have to say pleas, GME WILL FUCKING FLY AGAIN.

 UPDATE: Peterffy calls Robinhood decision to allow 'limited buys' of GameStop troubling: 'I'm not comfortable'

6:30 pm ET January 28, 2021 (MarketWatch) Print 

  By Mark DeCambre 

  Thomas Peterffy, founder and chairman of [Interactive Brokers Group Inc](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=7377679)., explained the rationale behind his brokerage firm's decision to put restrictions on investing in companies like [GameStop Corp](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905)., citing systemic risk as one of his biggest worries. 

  Speaking to MarketWatch on Thursday afternoon, Peterffy said that a  **so-called short squeeze can go on indefinitely** unless someone  intervenes, and it has the potential to ripple throughout the market.

A,l49mqd,2021-01-24 23:43:58,Options: A beginners guide (with greeks),"Alright retards, I've seen a big influx of new members here throwing away money on investments they know next to nothing about. This is meant to be a basic introduction to options prices. I am not a financial professional and this should not be misconstrued as investment advice. 

This will probably be long so **TL;DR:** Stop throwing away your money and learn about what you're buying. If you don't want to read [mike and his whiteboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmQ20J_3K7Q&list=PLPVve34yolHY43YaBegHMzN9WjrTnQfFr&ab_channel=tastytrade) is a good resource (I am not affiliated in any way). 

Initially wrote this at the end but I think it's better at the beginning:
**Practical Applications, General Advice**
-
General pointers for the newbies. Most of the option trading shown on WSB is OTM naked calls or puts with expiration < 3 weeks (*FDs*). **These are like lotto tickets and are not considered responsible investments by anyone, including us. They are retarded and we know it. You should know it too before buying.** Theta is usually insane and probability you make money is slim. On the flip side, selling these options is sometimes considered ok but is often **referred to as picking up pennies in front of a steamroller** due to the low return for high risk. If you want to preserve your hard earned money, make responsible plays. With options that usually means **~3 months minimum expiration, and strikes somewhat close to the money, if not in the money.** Consider the implications of IV in your trades, and make sure you understand the mechanics of the options before opening spreads. 

-------------

Options Basics

An option is a contract that gives you the option to buy (**call**) or sell (**put**) 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (the **strike price**) at or before a certain date (the **expiration date**). Options are priced **per share**, so a call with a listed price of $1 will cost you $100 total for 1 contract ($1 x 100 shares). For American style options (what most of you are trading) you can exercise at any time before the strike price, while European options (which are sold for major indices on American markets) can only be exercised on the expiration date. That doesn't matter too much for our purposes but I'll get into that later (EDIT: I never elaborated. This is really only important for [box spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boxspread.asp#:~:text=A%20box%20spread%20is%20an,strike%20prices%20and%20expiration%20dates.). They aren't allowed on RH and have their [own history here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zW86yXg7RM&ab_channel=MHFIN). Don't bother with them). 

Options have both intrinsic and extrinsic value. **Intrinsic value** is what that option would be worth at expiration. For example, if you have a $60 call in gamestop, and gamestop stock is at $65, your intrinsic value is $65-$60 = $5 (the difference your strike price vs what price you can sell it on the open market). An option will only have intrinsic value if it is **in the money (ITM)**, which means price is above strike for calls and below strike for puts. **Extrinsic value** is the time value of the option, and will vary based on the **implied volatility (IV)** of the option. The definition of implied volatility is complicated and tends towards circular logic if you apply it practically, but generally it can be thought of as how much options traders expect the underlying to move. If the stock moves a lot, IV goes up. If there's a big event, like an earnings report, IV goes up. If that earnings report passes, or the stock stabilizes, IV goes down. IV varies greatly depending from one stock to another and can change drastically depending on numerous circumstances, but as a generalization anything < 30% IV could be considered low and anything > 100% IV could be considered high. **Out of the money** options (price below strike for calls and above strike for puts), have value that is entirely extrinsic- for that reason they tend to have larger percent moves than ITM options. 


Greeks 

The greeks can be an intimidating topic but are extremely important if you want to trade spreads (more on this later) and I would argue anyone buying options should have a basic understanding of the greeks. This will be geared towards average/wsb investors, I'm not going to get into the other greeks here because they usually aren't as important for our purposes.

**Delta**: How much the option price will move relative to moves in the the share price. Positive for calls and negative for puts. It ranges 0-1, delta of 1 is equivalent to holding 100 shares, delta 0.5 is equivalent of holding 50 shares. Simple enough. This will increase as you are in the money and decrease if you are out of the money. An at the money option will typically have 0.5 delta, a far ITM option will have delta close to 1.

**Theta**: How much time value the option will lose per day. This is >0 (technically <0 if you are short, more on this later). A theta of 0.1 means the value of the option will lose $0.10/share/day, or $10/day. Theta increases as the expiration date becomes closer, so an option expiring this week will lose more money/day than one expiring next month (given same strike). For options of the same expirations, it will typically highest at the money and decreases as you move further ITM or OTM. [EDIT: Corrected]

**Gamma**: Rate of change of delta. This represents how much delta will change as the stock price moves. This is highest for near the money options and lowest for far ITM or far OTM options. 

**Vega**: Change in option price relative to on change in IV. High vega means the price moves a lot with changes in IV. This will increase with the amount of time left on the contract (more time = higher vega) and is typically highest at the money strikes and lowest for far ITM or OTM strikes. 

Buying/Selling Options

Just like stocks you can buy or sell individual contracts. You can also create positions that combine both long and short options, these are known as spreads. Individual contracts are fairly easy to understand and trade, though they typically come with higher risk and higher reward than their spread counterparts. 

**Long vs Short:** You can buy or sell options. Buyers can sell or exercise their contracts to close the position. Buyers need the stock price to move for their position to profit. Shorts can buy to close or wait for the option to expire. They will profit if the price stays the same (from theta) or moves in their favor. Increases in IV will help longs and hurt shorts, decreases in IV will hurt longs and help shorts.

**Calls:** Bulls buy calls. Their maximum loss is the initial cost of the call, their max profit is uncapped. They lose theta. Bears can sell calls (**naked calls**), their maximum loss is unlimited and their max profit is the initial price of the call. They gain theta.

**Puts:** Bears buy puts. Their max loss is the initial price of their put, their max profit is the strike price (stock can't go lower than zero), they lose theta. Bulls can sell puts (**naked puts**), their maximum loss is the strike price of the contract (stock price can't go below zero) minus the initial cost of the contract, their max profit is the initial price of the put. 

**Spreads:** Combination of a buy and a sell. These come in all different forms and allow all sorts of strategies that are impossible with shares or naked positions. In general there are **credit spreads** which is when you sell the spread and receive money up front, and **debit spreads**, which you buy the spread pay up front. When constructing spreads it's useful to know that the resulting greeks will be the sum of the greeks from all the contracts in the spread. So if you buy a call with delta 0.5 and sell a call with delta 0.25, your overall delta is 0.5-0.25=0.25. I'm only going to cover a few here because I'm getting tired but just know there are a ton of options trading strategies out there.

**Vertical Spread:** Buy and sell different strikes at the same expiration. For example, if I'm bullish on GME I can buy $60 calls and sell $65 calls for 1/29 (debit spread). The cost of the $60 call is offset by the $65, but the profit is capped at $5 per contract. Theta is lower (and can be negative) although delta and gamma are also lower. It's important to note that when the position is ITM, the overall spread price will be less than the intrinsic value of the spread due to the extrinsic value of the short leg (until you're insanely far ITM). For example, that $60-65 vertical spread will be worth <$5 even if GME is $75. The price of the spread will approach its intrinsic value as the remaining time on the contract approaches 0. I can also sell a vertical spread (credit spread), I will receive the difference in value of the two contracts and will need cash collateral to cover the difference between the strikes. For example, I can sell a $65 put and buy a $60 put. Since the $65 put is worth more I receive a credit (lets say $200), then I also need to put up $300 in additional collateral. If GME goes above $65 I can wait for the contract to expire useless or buy it back for cheaper than I sold it. If it goes below $65 my loses are offset by the $200 credit. If it goes below $60 my losses are capped at $300 by my long put (I buy shares at 65, sell at 60) and initial credit received.

**Iron condor:** Combination of two OTM vertical spreads, typically of the same width. Most people trade these short, the nice thing about that is your collateral can be shared between the call and put side, because there is no way for both sides to be ITM at the same time. If you're short you make money if stock price stays the same or if volatility goes down (basically the same thing). 

**Horizontal spreads:** Buy and sell the same strike at different expirations. AKA calendar spreads. Most useful for betting on changes in volatility. A long calendar spread (sell close expiration buy long) will be long volatility, a short calendar spread (buy close expiration sell long) is short volatility. You can also use this strategy for earnings plays, when you know the short dated options will lose more volatility than long dated options. These are most valuable near the money and will lose value as they go farther ITM or OTM. For this reason some traders will incorporate both OTM puts and calls into these positions. Calls are delta neutral at the money, slightly delta positive OTM, and slightly delta negative ITM (reverse for puts). 


That's all I have the energy for. Feel free to ask questions. Good luck out there.

GME,lbqd7o,2021-02-03 16:44:22,We should decentralize GME positions data by summing all our shares together.,"The wall street already have our data that are bought from Robinhood and other brokers. This gives them ton of advantage on figuring out which way to maneuver.

We are already at disadvantage because we do not have a clear picture how much shares WSB actually owns.

There are roughly 28M floating GME shares. If 500k out of 8m WSB subscribers own 56 shares each, it would mean WSB individuals are holding all of the floating. Which would mean shorts couldn’t have covered a lot past week. 

u/lasagnahog1 already piled up lots of data from recent posts. And he is willing to compile all our shares if we want. I propose that we all send him a DM with screenshots of our shares (nothing else, no name, no account numbers).

This way we can unite together and decentralize the power only wall street has as of now.

[https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2175282-arcelormittal-hikes-eu-steel-coil-prices-again](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2175282-arcelormittal-hikes-eu-steel-coil-prices-again)

Everyone that has read my posts know **$MT is my favorite play.**

The doubters in the beginning (and still - I do get your DM's - lots of angry people out there!) said this was a pump and dump.

$MT popped and then went sideways for a week or so - I said to wait and be patient.

That patience has started to come to fruition.

These increases are immediate and will be taken and like Oliver Twist - customers will say, ""please sir, I want some more""

$MT: ""More?!?!?""

$MT: No problem, it's another $50/ton""

Customer: ""Please sir, I want some more""

$MT: ""More?!?!""

$MT: Sure another $100/ton and it will ship in June, oh and by the way, you'll have to pay extra by then because your price is now the price we agreed upon and adders, so PRICE TIME OF SHIPMENT.

By the way, that is becoming common-place in the steel industry today.

As promised earlier today, here is a Force Majeure letter from Deacero, one of the largest steel makers in Mexico:

NOTICE HOW THE PRICE INCREASES ARE **RETROACTIVE??!!**

This is becoming common-place and this is how steelmakers ENSURE their margins in markets where raw materials are running faster than they can buy them.

This is part of my thesis as to why these companies are going to show INCREASED REVENUE and most importantly - **INCREASED PROFITS.**

Also, those that believe in what's coming and understand the value and dynamics in the market made some shrewd moves and **BOUGHT THE DIP!**

GME,l1tg88,2021-01-21 08:18:56,"GME - How shorts manipulated you, and how you can be better","Hello again folks. I’m working on another DD to add to my GME EndGame series ([part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/), [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/)), but I wanted to take an aside to share my speculations on the obscene amount of manipulation happening this week by the shorts, and try to give all of you advice on how you can be more successful on GME.

**TL:DR;** GME has tremendous potential and the only reason it’s not trading at $80+ is because of active shorting. Be aware about how your positions may be helping the shorts without you knowing.

# How shorts manipulated GME this week

I’m going to preface this by saying this is speculation based on events transpired and what I know about short tactics. Consider this a narrative of how a shorter could have orchestrated all of this. I will share data where I have it. For an understanding of some of those tactics, read this [great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l11ww7/legacy_of_wsb_jim_cramers_crash_course_in_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/mirkan__2.

Imagine you’re one of the big shorts on GME. You’ve been shorting this thing since 2017, 2018, 2019 and watched its stock price drop from 30 -> 15 -> 4 to a low of $3 in 2020. If you’re Bank of America, your analysts are telling you (and others) this [thing is going to $1](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/04/15848735/gamestops-short-term-sales-boost-to-power-down-soon-analyst-says).

But then things get out of hand, very quickly, with GME climbing from $3 -> $20 in 9 months and then in **ONE WEEK** doubling to $40. You were not prepared for this. It’s a disaster.

What do you do? You leverage every tactic you can to drive the price down.

**1) Attack retail investing capabilities:**

* Bank of America owns Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch has a retail brokerage. Since you’re short GME, you have your risk department over at Merrill Edge **increase the margin requirements on GME** strongly and suddenly on all retail buyers.
* **This causes a chain reaction**. Brokerages generally mimic the margin changes on other brokerages, because they don’t want to be the ones where all the “risky” traders go to. So other brokerages start increasing their requirements. Pretty soon, Schwab, Fidelity, Ameritrade, IBKR have all increased their margin requirements to the point that many buyers cannot buy more shares, or if they had bought on margin, need to liquidate or provide more capital.
* Meanwhile, the big guys - banks and hedge funds that are short - use [prime brokerages](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-prime-brokerage-4165497), and since I don’t have access to one I can’t confirm, but *very much doubt had any margin changes to GME.*

**2) Manipulative shorting:**

* On **Friday (1/15)** you take advantage of the fact that most call buyers on GME are not going to take assignment, so as they sell their calls which are now worth huge sums of money, Market-makers (MMs) are going to sell the shares they’re using to hedge the calls. So you short the stock as hard as you can, driving it down as low as 14% at one point, but it creates too strong of a sell-off triggering a short-sale restriction.

Great, at this point, you think you’ve killed some of the momentum going into the 3-day weekend. Hopefully investors will realize more of their mistake and sell off their foolish investment in the next Blockbuster. But then things go awry. Retail buyers are not shaken. In fact they’re enraged, and the GME movement grows more popular than ever, becoming the [most mentioned ticker](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1ey7e/heres_a_visualization_of_the_tomorrows_moves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and even getting a stickied thread each day.

The US markets are closed on Monday. Doesn’t matter. Europe takes the mantle, driving the price up from 35 at close on Friday in the US to 40, then 44. **Mexico** picks up the baton, where it hits 1000 pesos, or **$50/share on Monday at 11:30 a.m.** before coming back down a bit.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3y8c8fhixmc61.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e07fbb6fbd0fb39a15a0429d3096760ccf0556a

You’re about to get squeezed and you need to do something fast. You can’t short the price down Tuesday in US trading because of the short sale restriction, and the momentum behind GME is palpable.

So now you get more aggressive.

**3) Orchestrated media attack & shorting:**

* Here’s what you have to work with. There are **at least** **1.2 million** shares available to short in just IBKR, and more in prime brokerages thanks to all the retail buyers buying shares in Robinhood. [“Robinhood Securities earns income from lending margin securities to counterparties.”](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/how-robinhood-makes-money/#:~:text=Robinhood%20Securities%20earns%20income%20from%20lending%20margin%20securities%20to%20counterparties.) At a **54% borrow rate,** that’s quite a nice return for RH for holding your shares.
* You call up a famous shorter known for impacting equity prices - Andrew Left of Citron. Offer him tons of money to put out a hit piece on Tuesday after markets open. It doesn’t matter that he doesn’t have shit prepared and you need him to do this tomorrow. He’s just going to threaten an attack to kill the momentum.
* Tuesday market opens. GME **rockets up 25% to $45/share** within the first few minutes. Then comes the orchestrated attack.
   * Minutes before Citron’s tweet, you buy thousands of OTM puts.
      * **1000** 1/22 40p - **26 minutes before the tweet**
      * **472** 2/29 20p - **24 minutes before the tweet**
      * **2200** 1/29 30p - **11 minutes before the tweet**
      * **424** 1/22 40p - **10 minutes before the tweet**
      * **449** 1/22 40p - **5 minutes before the tweet**

[Biggest option trades on the day of Citron’s tweet. Note that almost all of the large, long option orders are longer term, but the puts are all short term, with many coming minutes before the tweet. Keep in mind, while all this aggressive, OTM, short-term expiry put buying was happening, GME was rocketing upwards. It’s pretty obvious this was planned and not a response to price action. ](https://preview.redd.it/a9naysrkxmc61.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac257a1212129b1aa7d234a77cb563498a4d4fd8)

* At 9:58 a.m. eastern (I’m on the west coast so timestamp is different), comes the tweet

https://preview.redd.it/jupelyppxmc61.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=08dc187be8fdd580bd418c43f682e526e5c346d1

* Note the language here:
   * Citron’s not revealing anything until tomorrow, when short sale restrictions are done. *I.e. you better not buy today!*
   * Price target of $20 **matching exactly the lowest strike price of the puts purchased just minutes prior**.
   * “I understand short interest better than you” - i.e. “the shorts are paying me and I know who they are, and why they’re shorting”
   * “Poker game” - ***he’s calling you a sucker, while at the same time tweeting a poker bluff***\*\*.\*\* He doesn’t actually have anything ready or substantial, but the shorts paid him off to threaten the market.
* Andrew Left fired his shot. Now comes the coordinated shorting.
* In about an hour, **all 1.2 million shares** in Interactive Brokers are used up.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f6do9e7txmc61.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=1017e67af75f3f85fc98425aa5b6154b255cd5c1

* Probably, prior to this, shorts used the invisible shares available from brokerages like Robinhood.
* Wait, shorts can’t short on restricted days, right? **Wrong.**
   * **They can short on the ask.**
   * When there’s fear in the market, organic sellers lower their ask to exit their positions.
   * Shorts high-frequency algos move their ask to match the lowest organic ask.
   * Organic seller really needs to get rid of these shares! Citron is coming! Sees he’s now not the lowest ask, so he moves it down.
   * Guess what? The algos match his ask and short at the lower price now.
   * **This cycle repeats as long as organic sellers reduce their asks to sell.**
* While all this is happening, **market makers are shorting/selling shares in response to the puts placed prior to the tweet,** helping push down the price.

Congratulations. **In a matter of less than an hour, GME has now dropped from $45 to $37/share - an 18% drop and an** ***absolutely incredible reversal of momentum.***

Citron didn’t even have to do shit. The next day they canceled their livestream claiming they *forgot about the fucking inauguration.*

# How to be smart

As you can see, there are a number of dirty tricks here. It’s sophisticated, coordinated, and the odds are stacked against the retail investor.

There are some things you can do to trade smarter.

* **OPEX.** Imagine if every trader out there took profits of their calls at expiration. In that scenario, MMs sell the shares they used the hedge the calls, leading to a downward drift in price. If instead people rolled forward winning calls, for example, MMs would not necessarily sell the hedge (depends on delta). Selling calls before expiry if you just want to take profits sometimes means you can avoid a drop on OPEX.
* **Robinhood lends your shares and doesn't pay you for it.** Some other brokers let you choose to lend your shares. I know I can choose to lend shares or not in IBKR. It’s up to you to lend or not, but don’t let your broker lend for you and earn all that free lending money.
* **Don’t sell on dips.** You’re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it’s heading up. *Sell high, not low retards.*
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. **Have patience when buying.**
* **Don’t buy calls on rips.** With everyone expecting a squeeze *at any moment* option premiums that are already high rocket to insane levels in minutes. When Citron canceled their livestream GME started to recover, call premiums skyrocketed. You’re absolutely fucked if you buy calls on rips, even if you’re right. Look at this call premium price history for today and *imagine just how fucked you are if you buy calls on rips*:

[Good luck profiting on calls if you buy on rips. ](https://preview.redd.it/hsofwiv5ymc61.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b7ee04c148c095e1f47613ded22844460fe768c)

* **Don’t advertise when you’re going to buy. Just buy dips.** There were so many folks saying “wait for 11:30 to buy!”. Well, look what happened! Just when you thought there’d be a dip, and you were all ready to buy, there was this magical, temporary rapid price spike. Congratulations, advertised to every predatory trader out there when you all were going to buy. Double-win for them: If you fomo’d in at 41 you’re probably gonna paper hands your way out when the shorts push it back down.
* **Don’t buy more than you’re willing to lose.** You need to hold through the dips, and be ok with the extreme volatility. IF you put too much into this all at once, you’re going to get scared when the price goes against you.
* **Consider exercising DEEP ITM calls.** I love u/DeepFuckingValue but he could be making more from his portfolio. He has $2.6M in cash from prior GME winnings but also 1000 April 12 calls. The april 12 calls **are trading at intrinsic value.** Exercising those calls right now would use up $1.2M of capital and add 100K shares to his account, but 1) it would not change the PnL of the portfolio, 2) would increase the liquidity (you lose on spreads when you try to sell deep itm calls), and 3) **would allow him to choose whether or not to lend the shares.** Right now, MMs have hedged his calls with 100K shares, **but they're lending them to shorts and making free money.** In the case of DFV, that's about **$6000 per day** in free money given to market makers for the privilege of lending his shares to shorts. **If you have the cash, and the options trading at intrinsic, consider exercising.** Whether you lend is up to you, but **don't give MMs free money.**

[u\/DeepFuckingValue's Portfolio. Exercising the April 12 calls would not impact his PnL, would increase liquidity, and would give him the option of lending shares \(and earning money\) or not. ](https://preview.redd.it/37hwj00gymc61.png?width=2804&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf3bb9864aee06d5d8c379b3413da2d6a7c7071a)

&#x200B;

* **HOLD.** There is so much upside in GME, *that it doesn’t matter what price you buy now if you have patience.* There are so many potential catalysts coming and if all of this dirty behavior is any evidence shorts are scared and looking for cheap buys to get out. **Don’t give up your shares for cheap.** Here’s a quick list of potential catalysts that could happen at any time and any of which would spell more pain for shorts:
   * Share recall for a vote on major issue
   * Cohen becomes CEO
   * Alan, Jim (chewy directors added to board) purchase shares (they are not limited in how many they can buy)
   * Cohen could buy his remaining 7%
   * New higher $ investors pile in
      * In my [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) I talked about how vc investors were going to start piling in and lo and behold a couple days later [one VC explained why he was buying gme](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) with a potential price target of **$800/share**

   * Debt upgrade
      * GME’s 2021 bond is done is March, the removal of which has many restrictive covenants
      * Getting to profitability and reducing debt may trigger a debt upgrade by Moody’s and unlock more institutional ownership

All of you need to have faith. **Even after all these shady tactics, GME is still up 9% from close on Friday.**",Discussion,1.0

GME,lbkyne,2021-02-03 11:44:46,DD: Why GME Valuation is valid at $300+?,"The 2020 pandemic year and onward has been the year of insane valuations. Whether attributed to more retail investor involvement, stimulus from the government, lack of spending elsewhere, the Fed, etc, some companies are the chosen ones for the high valuations while others don't get the privilege of being among WallStreet's favored.

&#x200B;

For the apes / autists in the group, company valuation is also called the market cap. It's the share price \* outstanding shares (not just float shares).

&#x200B;

GME Market Cap (Valuation) at $300/share assuming the number of outstanding shares is constant, would roughly be $21b ($300 \* 69.75M shares).  The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.

&#x200B;

Generally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.

&#x200B;

According to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36. Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) which is an in-person salon retail has a wopping 72.42 valuation with an annual consensus of $3.94 EPS. Source: [https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry\_Valuation.php?s=1300](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?s=1300).

&#x200B;

Now GME does have some baggage in that it hasn't had a profitable year in 3 years with the pandemic really hurting it. In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07. But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.

&#x200B;

🚀🚀🚀🚀Now, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

What Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations. TSLA P/E ratio is 1,380.65 whereas the current auto industry PE is 20.4. Toyota is 14.86. Even some of Wall Street called TSLA the 4-WTF Chart of the year - [https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/), but alas all the bears have kinda called it quits on TSLA with short interest at it's all time low. The valuation doesn't scare them with price targets above $1k. The difference? Enough people said f-u WallStreet, we like the company and believe in it so we are going to buy it and hold and don't care what you say and do.

That's 4 billion dollars you guys congratulations! Link to this:[https://buzzwind.com/en/d1-capital-stung-by-amc-short-bet-undone-by-reddit-traders/](https://buzzwind.com/en/d1-capital-stung-by-amc-short-bet-undone-by-reddit-traders/). Now they lost their money because they were shorting AMC. While Robinhood banned buying of GME yesterday and we all lost our minds it also banned the buying of AMC, allowing this hedge fund to exit it's short positions without enough trouble.   


If you read the holdings page for D1 capital it says that these firms are not required to disclose their short positions in their 13F. THIS IS MASSIVE! The hedge funds collude on what positions to short as they tend to short similar stocks.  [https://fintel.io/i13f/d1-capital-partners/2020-09-30-0?source=content\_type%3Areact%7Cfirst\_level\_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain\_content%7Cbutton%3Abody\_link](https://fintel.io/i13f/d1-capital-partners/2020-09-30-0?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)  


Another interesting 13F is from Woodline partners which was founded by Citadel Alum: [https://fintel.io/i/woodline-partners-lp](https://fintel.io/i/woodline-partners-lp). Look how it says -100% for AMC and NOK, suggesting to me that they might have started shorting these companies.  


Anyway howw does this all relate to Robinhood and its investors?? So it turns out 1/3rd of the money owned by D1 capital is invested in Private companies. It bought shares in robinhood in leading its series G for atleast 200 million dollars: [https://www.reuters.com/article/robinhood-funding-idUSKCN26E062](https://www.reuters.com/article/robinhood-funding-idUSKCN26E062)  


THIS IS IT! D1 Capital has stakes both in Robinhood and in atleast one short trade in AMC possibly more. They used their board position to force Robinhood's hand to shut down these shares to be bought so that their prices come crashing and D1 capital can exit its positions. Don't let this thread die. We need to upvote for visibility to SEC and Investigators.  


TL;DR D1 Capital has a board member in Robinhood and atleast a 200 million dollar stake. D1 Capital was shorting AMC and losing 4 billion dollars in such trade. D1 Capital is CROOKED AF this is insane and so blatant but i guess for 4 billion dollars u gotta risk it all

I want you all to think about the stocks you invested in when you first started investing 


When was the last time some rando work associate has asked you “hEy HaVe yoU hEaRD aBoUT GAMESTOP???” Probably this morning. I want you all to know that all those people who have had absolutely no insight on investing will want to put their GME (to da moon) winnings into solid Stonks just like we all did when we started investing. You all started with the FAANG MT. So will all these new degenerates who have just gotten into things. 

Remember Stonks only go up :)
