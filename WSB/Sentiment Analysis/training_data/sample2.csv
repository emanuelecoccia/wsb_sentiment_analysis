&#x200B;

* Volume bars on 4/16 and 4/19 are totally insane. Has to be institutional accumulation, a great sign.

&#x200B;

* Anchored VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) pinch from high and low of 2021 — watch for some bouncing around in this area and a break to the upside (hopefully).

&#x200B;

* Price now above curling upward 50-65 SMA cloud **and** curling upward 20-23 EMA cloud.

&#x200B;

* Resting on volume shelf below — if it dips, watch for a bounce (hopefully) off the $8.50 - $8.75 area, buyers seems to be interested in that level.

&#x200B;

* Breakout levels to watch marked on chart with the thick dotted line: $9.25 and $10.56. These are levels I drew myself and are definitely **not** 100% accurate.

&#x200B;

* Above $10.56 looking at a resistance volume shelfs between $12 - $13, then a smaller shelf between $14 - $14.30. Above that looking at relatively smooth sailing to break through all time highs of $17.45.

&#x200B;

* Maybe all these levels get blown away by a squeeze? I don't know.

&#x200B;

* Remember that I'm dumb. Do your own thing.

WISH,nvlkof,2021-06-09 04:56:35,"$WISH - world's most downloaded shopping app is a value play, MEGA DD!","Many autists wished for DD on $WISH. Here you go!

The DD here is purely looking at WISH as a pure value play and doesn't include any short-squeeze related information.

# Business

To keep it simple,

1. Wish is a global e-commerce platform that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers.
2. It allows sellers to list their products on Wish and sell directly to consumers.
3. The merchants on the platform primarily offer ***unbranded products that are deeply discounted compared to the alternatives. Most of the merchants/products are from china.***
4. They target customers looking for value goods people with annual income < 75,000 USD, plenty in US and Europe regions accounting for 90% of customers.
5. Wish does not stock the products themselves or manage returns.

# The Team

1. *CEO* [*Piotr Szulczewski*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Szulczewski) *a former Google Engineer*
2. *Exec chair - Jacky Reses (known for Square and works with Bill Ackman at Pershing square)*
3. *CTO - DannyZhang (Ex- Yahoo, ATT)*
4. *Best in class Technology team of engineers mostly from Facebook and Google*

Hunky dory there are so many e-commerce platforms why is WISH special ?

# Value Proposition

Looks at some of the stats here

[Activity Snapshot](https://preview.redd.it/hp99fuab85471.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=14a48935ccd3b4142a9070ac354568d30eab0c10)

WISH platform connects over ***100 million monthly active users in over 100 countries to over 550k global merchants***. Their main motto is to give users an affordable, personalized, and entertaining shopping experience leveraging their in house data science and marketing technologies.

# Value Proposition to Wish Users

The platform excels from the rest by making e-commerce

**Affordable -** Offer unbranded products to value conscious customers at deep discounts

1. **Accessible -**  built as a Mobile first platform for access across the world in 40 different languages
2. **WISH Local -** Partner with 50,000 brick and mortar stores, use them as pick up facilities and also allowing the stores to list their products on the platform

The standout features of the shopping experience

1. **90% of user activity occurs through Mobile App**
2. ***Discovery Based***  **- 70% of the sales on the platform do not come from a search query, meaning the user doesn't come to the platform to buy something that's on his mind but rather ends up buying a product browsing through the platform liking a deal**
3. Their marketing programs are top notch and they use big data technologies and AI in their approach to make it highly personalized. They look at facebook, instagaram, emails and messages to customize their recommendations. ***ok most of you that have seen The social Dilemma on NFLX. you got it.***
4. user experience is engaging and entertaining by having highly personalized feeds. on an ***average users spent over \~ 9 minutes a day*** on their platform in 2020

# What's in for the merchants in addition to being able to sell their products ?

1. access to 100 mil monthly users across 100 countries, digital presence for their stores
2. Through **ProductBoost,** they are able to market their products by paying WISH as ad revenue. **This is very similar to a TinderBoost feature. 30% of merchants use this feature**
3. WISH charges and offers logistics ensuring consistent delivery experience boosting their sales.

# Revenue sources

1. **Core Marketplace** \~ commission on the products being sold on the platform
2. **ProductBoost** \~ marketing ad dollars coming from the merchants
3. **Logistics** \~ providing logistics support to the merchants and getting paid

# Cost and Expenses

They are spending truck loads of money on user acquisition and marketing costs juts like any other early stage e-commerce player. In the long term they expect to spend 40%\~45% of their revenue in this area

&#x200B;

[Expected to be 40&#37;\~45&#37; going forward](https://preview.redd.it/vdxe4acke5471.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5dcbbfe8af527a2dc171ef2febb2a126481c6e9)

# Oppurtunitues Ahead

1. 43% of headcount involved in R&D related activities. Huge opp to drive efficiencies at scale
2. 10,800 wish power users and influencers to market the platform, selected based on their social following, this would heavily propel the customers and merchants growth
3. with covid-19 easing across the world, logistical nightmares would be eased
4. Further scaling of Wish local to bring in more brick and mortar stores on the platform
5. Adding new product categories and higher value products as needed by customers
6. increased spending domestically in US due to monetary easing and stimulus
7. Very solid base of long term customers, look at the chart showing the life time value of the users  from the time they started engaging

# Valuation

WISH , still not profitable with an EBITDA loss for Q1 2020 in the range of -60 million equals \~7% sales.

The company doesn not have any financial debt, has \~ $1.5 to$ 2.0 B in cash.

**Looking at their price to sales multiple, the stock is at a heavy discount compared to its peers**

**As of close today,**

|Platform|Price to sales ratio|
|:-|:-|
|ETSY|11.6|
|SHOP|44.44|
|SFIX (stitchfix)|3.844|
|BABA|5.579|
|Avg. Price to sales of 75 Retail (online) sales, data from A.Damodaran from NYU stern|4.52|
|WISH|**2.861**|

with a modest price to sales multiple of 5x, the stock should be trading at \~$24 to be modestly valued compared to other E-Commerce firms.

***TLDR***

*WISH is an undervalued stock play, heavilty discounted compared to its peers. Any price below \~$15 is a joke.*

*I do not care about short interest, Gamma Squeeze but if it helps then bring it on. There were multiple rumors in the past that it's being acquired by Amazon, e-bay. I see institutional intrest to be coming back into the stock.*

*Not selling a single share (1,000 shares at $10.56 avg) until it hits \~45. Might as well hit 60 if there are more WISHes from here.*

**Positions or ban**

DD,nabaik,2021-05-12 01:50:04,PLTR DD PART 2,"Suppers ready

Good news for some of you on the PLTR earnings report. I suppose you'll be interested in knowing what happened to the stock.

https://preview.redd.it/qwsurb22tky61.jpg?width=1057&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=093e0d476e651e4bcece86ae9f8b96238e4a374a

Here we see some squiggles. It shows that the stock's underlying price movement is becoming less influenced by Gamma and more by \*insert hand waves\* other factors. What other factors? Wouldn't you like to know. But typically gamma is healthy so I wonder if the other factors are less so.

So then we look at the short interest volume. With such a large price jump - did people increase short selling or decrease? Were these shorts a part of options dealings? Were they MM shorting in the dark market? Who knows.

https://preview.redd.it/u9vivncftky61.jpg?width=1069&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da7488cc42dde49754c6ba599ac23cb6c33dcf11

Slight increase but I wouldn't say uber substantial. But it definitely isn't a decrease.

Looking at the options:

https://preview.redd.it/pk3sz1mqtky61.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b44948c90a0f58bd3122e7f15d1f45cfef5fe27c

With a larger-than-expected increase in price, lots of options switched hands, mainly at the $20 at which \~150,000 calls became ITM and \~200,000 puts became OTM. Oof to those bag holders.

But the real interest is in how the options landscape changed. Yesterday's options:/

https://preview.redd.it/hbdu3y31uky61.jpg?width=1047&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccca5e3d569161e72bccbc00112a259a570487d2

 Todays:

https://preview.redd.it/7wd5k0d6uky61.jpg?width=981&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ba558de8d8847a3e71482faedf7e27595ea7311

Accounting for the switching of ITM/OTM you'll see a decent increase in calls (\~160k) and puts (\~118k). Since overall delta exposure doubled towards zero it can be said that the majority of those were dealer long and customer short. This is healthy behavior. Considering volatility dropped as well, this suggests continued upside. 

It seems as though the healthy earnings report re-vitalized the stock. There is still rocky ground, however, there may be resistance at $20 but with increased liquidity and stabilizing gamma, there is an argument to be made that it should go beyond. 

The caveat is that if there is downside if it starts causing liquidity issues again the stock may continue its previous trajectory until the options landscape changes more drastically. With okayish accuracy, you can see with increase in volatility, 1.6mil options will have to be hedged via purchasing underlying with 1.8mil via selling. So back to the 1.6:1.8 as before. (For those wondering, did the decrease in volatility today help the stock rise with 1.6million options needing hedging via purchasing with decrease in vol? or was it the prospect of tendies. Lemme know).

TL;DR: You deserve your tendies today but dont let them get cold.",DD,0.79

# Why?

$CLF AKA Cleveland Cliffs is one of the **largest producers of steel in america.**

Have you tried building a house? Getting gym gear? Did you try to get a huge infrastructure plan going for the US which includes streets, bridges, buildings and what not all built with steel? anything to do with steel **GOT FUCKING EXPENSIVE.**

**Because Steel is in huge demand, because now that covid is falling back, people want to buy stuff, build stuff and all needs steel. Steel prices went to the moon! THEY FUCKING TRIPLED!**

🌏 🚀 🌕

&#x200B;

[In a matter of months prices for steel TRIPLED](https://preview.redd.it/bir35uvtt7471.jpg?width=653&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aecc3e0e75d8551b90c57135f81c186c0ecc152b)

&#x200B;

# WHY $CLF?

# Because $CLF is a big fucking steel producer, profitable, undervalued as fuck, forecast EBIDTA of $5.6B at a share price of 20$! RIGHT NOW $CLF should be worth at LEAST 35$, and that's not even counting in that HRC prices are over 1600$

🚀

# SHORTS TRYING TO BEAT DOWN $CLF! 🚀

# Look at the chart:

**Price of steel increases over 50% in the same time, but CLF just trades 2$ higher than it did nearly 6 months ago? HOW is that possible?!**

&#x200B;

[2$ in nearly 6 months while the product increases over 50&#37; in price in the same time?!](https://preview.redd.it/uztdva1yt7471.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c97042edaaa86ab560ecb5b3df38357913928cd5)

&#x200B;

How do you explain, that a company that is this big, produces steel for whole america and where the **product price was raised by 50% and PEOPLE ARE STILL GRABBING IT LIKE ITS BLACK FRIDAY**.

&#x200B;

Waiting times on steel orders for big companies are as **over 3 MONTHS** and more with the buyers paying any price the company wants. **That means with the same steel output the company now EARNS 50% MORE per ton of steel than it did in january!**

But the share price only rose 2$ since january, just about 10%? Do you see the problem?? CLF should AT LEAST be trading at 50% more than in january, but obviously, because a company has basic costs (running a furnace, personnel et cetera) - but at some point, with EVERY DOLLAR MORE THE PRODUCT COSTS, THE COMPANY WILL EARN DIRECTLY.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Let's say producing a ton of steel costs 500$ in total. If the price of a ton goes to 750, to company makes 250$ profit. If the price goes to 1000$, the company instantly **doubles** it profit, with the steel price just increasing by 50%. Now if the steel price goes to 1500!, the company could make 1000$ profit. **Price doubled from 750$ per tonne, but PROFIT QUADRUPLED!**

Obviously there's a bit more to that, but that's the gist.

# WHY CLF - A CHAD CEO 🚀 🚀 :

# CEO LOURENCO GONCALVES is a fucking stud. HE knows the analysts are wrong and he KNOWS that people are shorting his company. And he WANTS TO FUCKING FUCK EM.

google CLF earnings call transcript

Read what he tells to journalists and analysts:

""**And then you say, well, Lourenco, the clients are complaining that they are not receiving steel. Yes**\[...\]. So they are basically collecting what they pointed for and we are taking good care of some of them, **some others we are not taking care** because I don't believe that they don't, they really even belong.""

**THEY JUST FUCKING DONT CARE about people complaining the prices are too high.**

""**Because we don't need all of this ""opportunistic"" players in the marketplace. They just destroy, complicate, gossip, talk on the phone, send fake information, do everything that we only done in the marketplace.** \[...\]. **So that's what we were working for. We are doing our mandate. We are doing our job. We are working on behalf of the shareholders of the company.**

I won't bore you with a ton of numbers that shows that **CLF is profitable** as FUCK, **undervalued** AS FUCK, have a ton of **CASH** and **shorts fucking with them** all the time. Look at the chart and tell me there is no reason with INSANE steel prices the **stock trades at JANUARY levels.**

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

# TLDR: 🚀

# $CLF is an american company that makes BANK, earns tons of money because steel prices went through the roof and are still trading at levels they were in january, but the product costs 50% more than it did in january. Their CEO is HELLBENT on crushing shortsellers and bad analysts.

# Fair price of $CLF should be at least 35$-40$.

Thanks to our pilots Kelly Latimer and Michael Masucci for flying the mothership today and their vital role in helping VSS Unity complete today’s spaceflight!

Twitter link for direct updates from Virgin Galactic team -> [https://twitter.com/virgingalactic](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic);

\- Take off! VMS Eve and VSS Unity have taken to the skies above Spaceport America, New Mexico.

\- VMS Eve is taking VSS Unity to a release altitude of 44,000ft. The climb to release will take approximately 60 minutes.

\- VMS Eve and VSS Unity are now at 30,000 ft, nearly half-way to release altitude.

\- Approximately 10 minutes from release, VSS Unity switches to its own battery power for avionics and control systems, and performs electrical, feather system and flight control checks.

\- VSS Unity is in its launch configuration and pilots are readying the rocket motor system. Awaiting clearance for release from Mission Control.

\- Release, release, release! VSS Unity has successfully separated from VMS Eve.

\- VSS Unity’s rocket motor has been ignited by our pilots CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay.

\- Rocket motor shutdown. Momentum will keep VSS Unity travelling upwards towards apogee.

\- VSS Unity enters coast phase. Tail-booms raised into “feathered” re-entry position.

\- VSS Unity, our two pilots and [NASA\_Technology](https://twitter.com/NASA_Technology) supported experiments are now in space.

\- VSS Unity reaches apogee.

\- VSS Unity is descending back to Earth.

\- The feather has been lowered and VSS Unity is now gliding smoothly back to the runway at Spaceport America.

A successful test flight + landing!

EDIT: - Touch down, VSS Unity.  **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

EDIT2: Their smoke trail looks the same as their stock will do in the next week (had to insert this joke, sorry).

EDIT3: For people who were panicking on twitter due to motor shutdown - it's per procedures, it's what the motor HAS and HAD to do, everything is perfect.

UWMC,nlpfk9,2021-05-26 21:34:02,UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me,"I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",DD,0.88

I understand the majority of the interest on this sub is a few major meme stocks, but I would like to direct attention to a somewhat new ticker.
UWMC is the nations #1 wholesale mortgage lender based out of Michigan. They have a variety of advantages over their competitors in the mortgage field. 
I understand a lot of people are trying to move the sub away from chasing short squeezes, however it is worth nothing that this stock is sitting at 20.5% short interest and the borrow rate is quite high https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc . I have already seen a few posts directed at this stock and it’s potential. I would recommend this quick read as if it details the fundamentals behind this great buy https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv6f2d/could_uwmc_be_the_next_moonshot/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

UWMC,nv6f2d,2021-06-08 17:23:40,Could UWMC be the next moonshot?,"**I believe that UWMC is a great value play, but also that there are many potential catalysts that might send this thing to the moon. Let's take a  look:**

\> 20.5% of the float is shorted.

\> Is insanely profitable: EPS is up 592% this year, 821% Q/Q.

\> Trading at a forward P/E of 9.91.

\> Many whales already own a shit ton of shares, but many apes have not even heard of it yet.

\> Analyst buy recommendation (5 out of 7).

\> Dividend of $0.40, paid quarterly $0.10 (4.5% yield).

**There is definitely a possible (not guaranteed, but the ingredients are there) short squeeze:**

20.5% of the float is short. That’s just below SPϹE (24%), QЅ (23.8%), and VXRТ (21%) and higher than ЅRNE (20.2%), SENЅ (20.4%) and AMϹ(19%).   The volume is slightly below the average for the last few months. But  all it needs is a smidge of momentum and this thing could explode. Look  at the break outs the rest of  them are having, and many of those  companies aren’t making any money.

**Which brings me to my next point: PROFITABILITY**

(TL;DR for apes: They are making so much money.)

EPS is up 592% this year, and 821% Q/Q. That’s insane. Forward P/E is 9.91. EV/EBITDA is 1.7, P/S is 2.48. Let’s compare these numbers to a peer, $OCN:

ОCN’s EPS Q/Q is  36.7%, and the stock is up 17.71% in the quarter. UWMϹ’s EPS Q/Q is up 821% and the stock is only up 1.37%. Any guesses why? *ОCN’s short float is only 1.24%****.*** *UWMϹ’s is 20%*. Hmm....

**$300M Share Buyback**

May Q1 Earnings Quote: “As you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of   $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I   always explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special dividend or a share buyback program. As you guys have seen, we concluded share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward shareholders. We announced the authorization of $300 million share buyback over the next 24 months. And quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that.”

**Dividend**

Remember, “It costs nothing for me to hold, but it costs them to short?” Well on this one, you actually *get paid to hold*. **4.5% per year** at the current price. And would you look at that, we’ve got a quarterly dividend ex-date coming up on June 9th, $0.10/share.

**Insider buying**

One insider, Robert Verdun (director), dropped half a million on shares at  $7.87. Insiders sell for many reasons, but there’s only one reason they buy. And we’re not far above his purchase price right now. The CEO, Mat Ishbia, has committed to not selling his shares anytime in the near future as well.

**Earnings**

Expected sometime in August/ September. Earnings expectations have already been raised once in the last 30 days, 2-3 months out. I could see this running up to earnings.

**TL;DR**

UWMϹ has 20.5% short interest, insane growth compared to peers, 4.5% dividend, great financials, low IV (for now). Anybody know what UWMϹ stands for? Ultimate WSB Moon Cruise 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌜

As seen by a recent post here that has been gaining traction, $CLF is a ticking time bomb of fundamentals and shorts getting fucked.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvscvi/clf_crushing_shorts_with_steel_beams

The post above highlights some of the points on why the stock is an amazing play.

The link below shows the latest short interest report with 21% SI

https://fintel.io/ss/us/clf

""The 6 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Cleveland-Cliffs Inc have a median target of 24.50, with a high estimate of 33.00 and a low estimate of 20.00. The median estimate represents a +20.93% increase from the last price of 20.26.""

https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=clf#:~:text=Cleveland%2DCliffs%20Inc%20(NYSE%3ACLF)&text=The%207%20analysts%20offering%2012,the%20last%20price%20of%2019.87.


This is already a no-brain play. The price of the stock has been suppressed for weeks by shorts and it is a ticking time bomb. B

https://youtu.be/kcagi2icXaU

Even the CEO has said these analysts should kill themselves.

The price of steel is at an all time high which means that the profit margins of companies lik CLF, who are vertically integrated with mining, processing, and producing are higher than ever. 

Let's take a look at the options chains

EXPIRING THIS WEEK:

8,000 OPEN INTEREST ITM CALLS EXPIRING
24,000 OPEN INTERESTED OTM CALLS EXPIRING WITHIN 10% price difference.

EXPIRING NEXT WEEK:

30K ITM
30K OTM WITHIN 10%

With a 10.123B market cap @ 20.27 a share we are looking at 500M shares.

WITH THE CALLS EXPIRING WE ARE LOOKING AT 6,000,000 SHARES ALONE WHICH EQUALS MORE THAN 10% OF THE FLOAT.

With a realistic price target set 20% higher than current price, and a massive surge in options being exercised within 10%, I'm expecting a share price of AT LEAST $30 short term. I'm surprised this stock hasn't had more publicity in forums personally so I thought I'd add onto the post I saw earlier.

BB,nlqklx,2021-05-26 22:23:50,A Deep Fucking Value: Why BB is More Than Just a Short Squeeze; And Why It’s Worth $100 A Share,"First off. Forget that Blackberry is a phone company. Blackberry is a growth late stage start up that utilizes the logistics and patents of an old phone company

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That’s $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

This stock is a deep fucking value",DD,0.8

GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

Since my last post, we have seen good signs for Tilray- consistently green days. I have been tracking the technical indicators and it appears longs are heavily favored for a trade in the short term. See the technicals below:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is a daily technical analysis which favors 9 bullish technical indicators to 1 bearish indicator.

In addition, you can see 11:1 favorability on the daily moving averages.

&#x200B;

Things get interesting because the volume is gradually increasing with the combination of the share price increasing.

Using Fibonacci retracement + other technical indicators I believe a break of  23.49 resistance could lead to a big daily rally.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Comparatively, we saw some big rallies in popular reddit names today- specifically CLOV.

[CLOV had a SI ratio of 0.99 before the takeoff + a short volume ratio of 0.5 a day before the big move](https://preview.redd.it/e19ashksu4471.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9903821f22c8cf3e3cf28d48aad3b959fed3d13)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[TLRY currently has an SI ratio of 1.86 and short vol ratios ranging from 0.15-0.55](https://preview.redd.it/1kk7h8e0v4471.png?width=1340&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6e10f931e13e4a1fe187b87965494d041496810)

&#x200B;

TLRYs SI is moderately higher than CLOV- the share price keeps increasing in addition to volume. The question really is, how long can TLRY stay green and maintain momentum? At this point it's not a matter of if shorts cover, but WHEN will shorts cover? This high short interest is unjustified as Tilray has announced very bullish fundamental news including: new product line, recent reverse merger with Aphria, and strong regulatory statements on medical cannabis. My price target for the short term is: $120.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1 month chart of TLRY looks beautiful:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I believe the key here is consistent volume + eating up the ask for a big win for WSB. All my buddies out there who bought at 70, we are coming back for you! :)

MSCI,nj0cj6,2021-05-23 06:52:57,Detailed analysis on why UWMC’s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst,"**UPDATE:** /u/5349 made a critical observation (with a confirming follow-up source from /u/33zombee) that the market cap ranking for MSCI is ***free-float adjusted***. They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

>[BlackRock iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) \- Net Assets $4.12 Billion  
>  
>~~0.16%~~ (0.02%) \* $4.12 Billion = ~~$6.59 Million~~ ($824 K) corresponding to ~~816,800~~ (102,100) shares @ $8.07.

>~~0.16%~~ (0.02%) \* $950 Million = ~~$1.52 Million~~ ($190 K), corresponding to ~~188,350~~ (23,500) shares @ $8.07.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.",DD,0.82

EDIT: AMC STOCK is at a record high because of us apes. As a business with no ape backing, it is not worth what it is now. I guess I made it seem like I would be holding post squeeze? That is not the case. I am going to ride the wave up and get out and die in the void of fucking space. Be sure to sell when the profits meet your expectation and do not gamble with money that you cannot afford to lose. 

**Derp:**

We are at a critical point for AMC; either we make it or don't. I have the utmost faith in the community and in all the shareholders that we are going to be able to hold and not succumb to the pressures of major financial entities. I, for one, will not be selling. I have waited 6 months and invested thousands of dollars into an idea and cause that I believe. It is a total success or complete failure for me. I am not saying that it needs to be that way for you, but we can only win this together. I have been reading a lot of varying opinions on the future of AMC stock. From a technical standpoint, we have reached the top. However, if we can develop a strong uptrend, we can win. I just wanna be that guy getting his knob slobbed in the handicap stall in a Wendy's bathroom for once in my miserable cuck life. 

**Technical Analysis:**

We are at a major determining point for AMC First, let's look at the Daily (left side): We hit an RSI of around 96 the second time and are highly oversold. The first time it markets a temporary Top! Normally a stock moves in Waves. We detached from the MAs and are likely to return to the 50 EMA earlier or later. Volume Analyses also show signs of excessive bullish volume we normally see on overshooting tops.

Let's look at a shorter time frame now (4h - right side): We see a weakening RSI. The Trend has not broken down so far, and the 9 ema is still holding. I suggest at least set a stop or Trailing stop below here. The VolumeAnalyses is showing sell signs (red triangle down) In case of a pullback, the first ""Volume support"" is around 15, marking the top of the prior re-accumulation phase. A backtest of the ""last point of support"" is normally needed to confirm the bias and regain strength for the next move. The bullish scenario would be a pullback on low volume that is holding the support zones.

However, Exploring Gann fans. AMC has been respecting the 1:2 and trading in that channel. If the Current low respects the 1:1 trend line, then there's room for a move from 45 to 216 in one day. Not that it will, but that's the ""reasonable"" limit. If it significantly breaks the 1:1, well, then the fun's over, I suppose.

Note: Gann Fan is built using the lows from the 24th and 27th; the connection to the close on Friday is a coincidence.

You're making money right now on $GME, $AMC, $BB, or whatever. Allow me to introduce you to a company with boomer level fundamentals that took a haircut during the pandemic and is set to fucking explode. 


The company name is Tellurian, ticker is $TELL.


--------MY KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND----------

Even though I have a double digit IQ, I am in charge of keeping energy producers from blowing up, spilling fuck loads of oil, catching shit on fire, and/or keeping seafood fresh and hydrocarbon free. I've been in the business for many moons. I have dealt with MANY companies. I’ve seen MANY business types, I have seen transitions in business models as producers have dealt with energy price crashes. I work directly with company executives all the way down to operators and hands. I like talking to everyone and absorbing as much knowledge as I can, even though I’m mentally retarded.

Even though you morons can’t read, have your wife’s/gf’s boyfriend read this to you and DRILL it in your fucking smooth brain: LIQUID NATURAL GAS (LNG) DEMAND IS RISING AND WILL CONTINUE TO RISE FOR THE NEXT DECADE (“dEcAde” is a period of ten years for you single digit IQ fucks) AND BEYOND. LNG will be the “transition” fuel between dirtier energy sources and ""green"" energy. This transition is coming sooner than we think. 


Are you following?


What's this LNG, you might ask. You need to liquefy gas (basically “concentrating” it) so that it becomes economical to ship overseas. Overseas markets for LNG is massive and growing. Seriously look it up, EU, China, and others are increasingly relying on the stuff. It’s much more expensive for them to produce than the US.

When a producer (the company that puts together millions of dollars to drill a well) drills for oil, if your drill and zone prediction (a “zone” is the area that a geologist, paid for by the producer, finds to contain oil) is correct, 99% of the time, three products will flow to the earth’s surface in your process. These three are water, oil, and NATURAL GAS. Producers will separate oil and water dispose of this waste water into a disposal well thousands and thousands of feet deep. Producers will then sell the oil.… What happens to the gas?? Well, if the producer is lucky, there will be a pipeline within a mile or two of their well. They will have to pay WAY over 200K to 500K just welding a mile of gas pipeline to tie into this sales line then pay 100 to 250K for a LACT unit. This is why oilfield welders have fewer IQs than I do but make $150/hr, depending upon pipeline wall thickness (dependent upon flowing pressures and how safe the producer wants to be if not bound by DOT regulations)

If these costs aren’t too high, and the well is producing as much product as expected, then great, they sell gas. However, if they're producing less oil than predicted, or they're producing thousand of barrels of water per day, their disposal costs will be so high, they can’t afford to build the pipeline, they will just burn the stuff. Seriously, I can not tell you HOW MUCH GAS IS JUST BURNED. The VAST majority of producers just “flare” the gas. Just the “flare” vessel is like $30K. Imaging paying $30K to burn LNG that's worth 100s of thousands of dollars. I worked in the Permian basin in West Texas. Anyone here with this experience can vouch for me. At night, in the Permian, the sky is literally lit up with these flares. It’s like you're a goddamn ant on a fucking birthday cake that’s for both for your great great great mothers and her boyfriend’s birthday (basically a shit load of candles). It’s an amazing sight.

­---------wWhY dO tHeY DoO WasTE gAAS??------------------

You’re in the middle of fucking NOWHERE. You’d have to run hundreds of miles of pipeline to sell the gas. This would cost more than drilling the well. No company in their right mind would do this. The only options is to flare it. This one company I was working for was burning over 100K worth of natural gas per MONTH PER WELL, they had FIVE wells. The US just burns the crap, we can produce it so cheap, it just makes more sense to burn it rather than bothering to sell it. Gas is a nuisance to us. Other countries would die for it. There is actually new technologies that converts LNG into GASOLINE for cars. If you’re a stupid brain dead fuck who doesn't believe me, fucking Google it. 



-------So what about this TeLlUriAn coMpaNIee?-----------

Charif Souki started Tellurian. If you don’t know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, pioneered the LNG industry. He and his team are impeccable. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Enerny (about 2 hours from my house), a company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80/share. 
He was fired because Carl Ichan was a complete bully. The business was not being built to Soukies vision. Soukie took the best staff members along with him and started Tellurian. Can you imagine their trust in this guy? Leaving an established company to start a new one... LNG business model is requiring a change and Soukie realizes this. It will need to be produced at less cost, current business models aren’t sustainable. Cheniere Energy is over 20 BILLION dollars in debt. Yes, $20 BILLIOOONNNNNNNN. Guess how much debt Tellurian has? ZERO, NONE, $0.00. This is UNHEARD of in a new company in this industry. 

Tellurian just signed a 10 BILLION dollar purchase agreement from ONE company. TELL is currently talking deals with at least 4 other companies. This 10 billion dollar deal is a 10 year agreement. This is 1 billion per year. Their current market cap is just over 1 billion. Do you realize yet how undervalued this company is?? It’s mind blowing. They begin their Driftwood facility construction in Louisiana this summer. This will be the terminal to export LNG, 32 billion dollar project.

Do you know whats even better?? They wont completely rely on third party producers selling them gas to liquefy, BECAUSE THEY DRILL AND PRODUCE THEIR OWN GAS. They started drilling again after a brief pause due to covid-19. We pay for monthly reports of all producers who receive state permits for drilling. Just this month Tellurian has TWO permits.

Souki uploads regularly to YouTube (seriously what other major high level executive does this??), he was on Jim Cramers show multiple times, Jim Cramer was always contrary to Souki’s predictions, and SOUKI ALWAYS turned out RIGHT. Look it up, these are Jim Crammer’s words, NOT mine. Just a day or two ago, Souki said in his YouTube video “we are preparing for the ride of a lifetime.” I assume this is his way of telling us “buy in now you fucking retards” without being fined by the SEC.

------------HOW is ThiS LIKE GME, AMC, BB?-----------------

THE SHORT POSITIONS OMG YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS BY NOW. IT’S 17%!! Most of these positions were taken out at pandemic start. The joke is on them, Tellurian paid off their debts during their worst time HAHAHAHAHA. There WILL be a short squeeze. These shorts have no fucking clue about this dream team, the true depth of industry, and future of LNG production. 


---------------------hOw MuchH CanI MAKe?---------------------

At the VERY VERY least, I’m betting we run to pandemic level of $10-11/share (REMEMBER THIS WAS BEFORE THEY EVEN SIGNED ANY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS!!!). Calls are still cheap.

The only way to stop these types of organized and unwarranted short attacks is to punish the perpetrators financially, again and again. Then, and only then, will you have a free and fair market for all.

$GME is the perfect example of how individual investors discussing the value of a company and deciding they like the stock enough to buy shares and options, can have a profound and unintended effect. And as a consequence of that effect, some folks who often make a living pedaling lies and half-truths, lost a lot of money. As I see it, there is no better lesson than a bought lesson.

Still, as a value stock it is way way way undervalued. You can buy and sell it till the cows come home, when earnings come out this stock is likely going to shoot up just like Dicks did. I'm giving you a suggested play is all.

So there you have it. I am not a financial advisor blah blah blah blah blah you fucking fools.

2. I read somewhere today that the squeeze hasn’t even happened - will I know when it does? What is a squeeze and what do people realistically expect to happen when the squeeze happens? Does it happen out of nowhere or are there predicted dates that squeezes happen?

My yesterday’s AMC analysis and some of your comments were referred to in [CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/). Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it’s a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle’s tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle’s opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you’re happy now, u/memetron9000!

DD,nujg0y,2021-06-07 20:18:32,EMERGENCY DD,"Fellow retards,

I need you all to focus for just a few minutes please. I've been a member of this sub long before any of you bought your first FD. I'm not against new tards or trying to gatekeep anyone. But anyone in this cesspool, especially the newer members, need to know what they're up against.

Day after day the front page and daily are being spammed with shill accounts or bots and people are blindly following it. Or maybe the mods are asleep at the wheel or bots can move posts faster than genuine posts. Idc what your positions are, what you stand for, just get those bags.

These are just some of the tickers I see being shoved down your throat all over this sub from people/accounts that are suspicious to say the least. As many of you may know, Citadel who has major undisclosed and still open short positions against GME and AMC is long on these companies that are being spewed here in WSB. So if you have any interest in either of these heavily manipulated stocks and maybe don't want to to the bidding of these abusive short hedge funds, consider what they are trying to manipulate in this sub.

Also, please note, these are just the disclosed positions. Short positions are not disclosed on 13F's and they do not directly equate to those short positions. Married options do exist and they are often used to ""adjust"" a hedge funds overall position/leverage so they don't get a call from marge; but this still gives us some insight even if its not the whole picture.

Don't believe or buy everything you see on this sub. That should be a given but hoping this post sheds some light as to why you'll see shit on the front page or 9/10 comments in the daily mentioning the same ticker all from accounts with the ""frequent commenter"" (because they're constantly spamming) and created somewhere between January 20-Feb 10th.",DD,0.89

Michael Burry, the infamous investor who profited massively off the 2008 housing bubble is predicting, like many others, a collapse of the bond market. (Source: Scion Asset Management 13F) [He was even payed a visit by the SEC due to this warning](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-says-hell-stop-tweeting-after-sec-regulators-paid-him-a-visit/articleshow/81569128.cms), prompting him to delete his twitter account.

The FED only has two options at the moment:

Raise rates to curb current inflation. This would cause the treasury to raise its coupon rates (bond interest), which would mean lower bond prices. This means the government has to pay higher interest, ultimately leaving the treasury no other option than defaulting on its obligations.

2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.

Option one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back. Option two, the public goes bankrupt due to hyperinflation.

Either way, a short position would profit in this trade.

BB,nqsgln,2021-06-02 20:20:02,$BB 🍇🍇,"People underestimate Blackberry's QNX operating system as a secure RTOS (Real Time Operating System) based off of microkernel architecture. 🚀

For those who don't know how a RTOS microkernel operates let's explain with minor detail. QNX is one of the most adopted embedded OS's in the world it's installed in defense systems, power plants, municipal grids, robotics, rockets, rail and 175 million vehicles and rising.🚀

The reason for it's adoption is because of the way a QNX Neutrino RTOS operates compared to what we consider typical everyday operating systems. Most operating systems including IOS, Windows, Linux(Android) and MacOS to name the most apparent run on monolithic designs or hybrid kernels.🚀

A true microkernel architecture like QNX Neutrino RTOS has full memory protection which is built in meaning that any component can fail and be restarted without corrupting the microkernel or other components in the system. If failure does occur, QNX has the ability to rectify the problem without affecting any other part of the system through process monitoring and recovery components. This feature and ability equals extreme reliability, security and being a microkernel the OS is also modular.🚀

So what is the big deal your probably asking, Apple, ABC, and Microsoft might enter the space? Not exactly, in fact there has been work in this space from all three companies. Apple opened a facility across from QNX in Kanata and hired the ex creator of the OS Dan Dodge in 2016 to work with Mansfield on the autonomous car project called project Titan. The need for a secure and stable software is where Dodge and his decades of experience from QNX come into play.🚀

The need for a software system as reliable and secure as QNX should be a big flag to the sheer potential of QNX. It is clearly a threat and tough competition for even the biggest software companies. Not only this but project Titan continues to be illusive revealing possible setbacks and interference in trying to compete but also Apple lost several top managers from it's Apple Car project causing a potential setback to the launch revealing some attrition in the project.🚀

QNX version (7.1) is years ahead and analysts predict the next competitor is still 5 years away from anything even remotely close.  QNX hypervisor 2.0 is 61508 SIL 3 certified and has been recognized as ISO 26262 ASIL D compliant making it the world's first ASIL D safety-certified commercial hypervisor. 🚀

As other's race to catch up, BlackBerry has been filing patents on it's system.🚀

The QNX Hypervisor utilizes patented and patent-pending technologies that simplifies how elements are shared on the system. Multiple OS's can use 1 display controller to render content onto multiple displays, aka digital instrument clusters and infotainment.🚀",DD,0.94

DD,n9x2bw,2021-05-11 15:30:54,UWMC: My Final DD on UWMC in Light of Q1 Earnings and Guided Q2 (Though Prior to Earnings Call),"Righty-o. This is my final DD on the stock. I'm going to continue purchasing more and more shares, selling way OTM covered calls to be able to buy even more shares up until such a point as my cost basis is below the share-price (My average being roughly 7.5 right now), or the share price nets me a dividend yield below 5.5%. I'm currently wholly allocated to this, and that's why while it would be attractive at a 3% or 4% yield, I'm not going to keep continuously purchasing it. After a certain threshold is reached in regards to the share-price I'll just use the premium on covered calls, and the dividend as a backboard to purchase other securities at that point in time. Considering any shares I buy at 6.38 will net me a dividend yield of 6.26% yield, and the premiums on monthly options that are at 7.5-10 can range from 40 cents to 13 cents for that month for May 21.., I'm well capitalized to receive a minimum 15-20% annual interest on this stock while ensuring significant upside protection in that if my covered calls are exercised they would be exercised at a significant premium to my average cost basis.

T Stock currently has a 6.4% dividend yield. Look at it's balance sheet. Look at UWMC's. Then look back at T's. You'll understand why it's considerably safer to park your money in UWMC. The Payout Ratio for T stock also takes up the majority of earnings per share and by a strong degree, whereas UWMC by dint of its Class A dividend shares only being 1/16th of the shares has a dividend payout ratio that is essentially nothing at 41.5 million dollars a year.

Add to the fact that UWMC has just declared a 300 million share buyback, when the public float is equivalent to 693,000,000 and you see why I think things are going to change by dint of the fact the company is flat out going to be able to buy 43.2% of the float  of exactly 110 million shares. Considering that the dividend is over 6.2% while their senior notes have interest payments of 5.5%.... It makes complete sense for them to immediately start doing buybacks starting today, which is the day they are allowed to start.

Here are some of my thoughts after reading the earnings report please be aware that this was with the share price at roughly 6.5:

The Earnings Report was a decidedly mixed bag, and there's no two ways about it. Here are some of my thoughts that are additional:

1. The 49.1B in origination was a whiff, as they guided for 52-57B in originations. Gain on sale fell right in the middle-ish which was fine. I was right to guide for a little less or roughly 1B in net income, and if the salaries, commissions, and benefits hadn't increased exponentially 123,624 million they would have met right around 1B at 983,624,000.
2. I like they are guiding up as opposed to everyone else for Q2, and considering their miss for Q1 I feel they may even be being conservative so as to not disappoint again. One thing I didn't like was that their gain on sale margin was expected to be .75%-1.1% for Q2, but one part of that may be that they have an in-house jumbo program where they retain servicing which might compress margin. With that said, there is definitely a pricing war going on, and as the CEO of LDI said we don't know when that'll end but as he stated no one likes to sell something for ninety cents on the dollar, and we can expect higher margins when the pricing war cools. Please note RKT's wholesale margin is expected to be 1%.
3. I like that they are investing in "" Continued investment into machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to further advance our operational excellence while driving down costs."" Margin expansion is key, especially since they already have a margin advantage.
4. I like that they have ""Continued to invest in our technology platform and on-site teams resulting in additional operational efficiencies focused on reducing costs, reducing closing times, and increasing loan processing speed"" since, again, margin advantage. I also like reduced closing and loan processing speeds.
5. I like that: ""Our continued investments in the cloud, as well as technologies that increase Underwriting efficiency, such as Automated Document Recognition and Optical Character Recognition, have strengthened our technology advantage while driving greater efficiency, and reducing both fixed and variable costs."" Ditto with everything else.
6. Their jumbo and government portion of both refinance and purchase are extremely low relative to Q1 2020 because they only turned the spigot back on them the latter part of March. This is probably why it's so low, and why they are guiding up. Remember the gain on sale margin for government loans are smaller than conventional though so that might help explain some of the margin compression. This should also help them Q3 and Q4.
7. The seasonally adjusted annual homebuilding rate is at over 1.7 million home as April. There is a 4 million home backlog, and to keep up with demand home builders need to build 1.2 million homes a year. It needs to be more than 1.2 million to start reducing the backlog.
8. RKT's share price was roughly 20 dollars when it announced its 1 billion dollar buyback and had a market cap of 40 billion at the time. UWMC's market cap is roughly 10.8B. So it's market cap is exactly 27% what RKT's was at the time of the buyback. But the share buyback is 30% of RKT's. So there is more bang for buck. Additionally, there was a 1.1B special dividend of 1.1B which equated to roughly 5.5% at 20 dollars. The current annual yield on UWMC is over 6%. What's more, doing share buyback will increase EPS, net income, cash flow, and the balance sheet as opposed to RKT where it will only help EPS. Therefore, there is strong upside to be had at this price point.
9. I like that their highest expense (employees) is variable and stands at above 2/3rds of their expenses since it's easy to downsize in times of hardship, or they can choose to maintain staffing levels but not replace people to leave for a natural deceleration of income.
10. RKT  is expecting closed loan volume of between 82.5 to 87.5B. That's a sharp decrease in origination volume of between 15.5% and 20.3%. This is an strong indication that the UWMC ultimatum knee-capped them. Please remember that the UWMC Ultimatum deadline was March 15, and Q1 is for the period ended March 31 for RKT. Please note that the Partner Channel isn't just wholesale broker's as they also lump other things in there like their correspondent (referral) channel there. I also found the 7.5% increase from 37 and something to 40 billion from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 to be quite small regardless, but Q2 makes clear you can expect downward guidance on their Wholesale channel. Now, while UWMC may have won the wholesale volume war, it's paying a price. The entire wholesale channel is. While rates rising means a lower gain on sale margin, the pricing wars are cutting deep into gain on sale margin to. With that said, there is eventually going to be rationality as this cannot go on forever. No one likes to sell something for ninety cents when they can sell it for a dollar. So I call the gain on sale margin variable in essence. Finally, I expect investments to bear fruit and increase margin offsetting some of the pricing wars affect on GOS (for both sides to be fair).
11. I'm revising my expectations of 2-2.5 Billion dollars a year in net income to roughly 1.5-2.25 Billion, and I am being very conservative on the low end. I am calculating roughly 500 million in net income for Q2 2021 to be somewhat conservative. The way I am coming to that conclusion is by calculating a 49.1B origination for Q2 even though they are guiding for 51-55B (and considering the embarrassment of the whiff, and the new products they have on offer to increase capacity, I believe them to be conservative). I am also assuming a 75 basis point margin on gain on sale which is a touch more than 34% of the margin for Q1 2021. Under these presumptions they would be making 368,035,000 in loan production income. I am going to flat out live in delusion land and assume that Mortgage Servicing Income remains the same at 115,205,000 after accounting for the fact that mortgage servicing income minus change in fair value, plus gain on sale, and interest income equals that. That totals revenue of 483,240,000. I am going to assume the absolute worst and assume that they don't compress their expenses whatsoever and so their expenses will tally 317,000,000. Thus their net income will be 166,240,000.

I won't place the income tax because: ""UWMC's net income for periods prior to the first quarter of 2021 does not reflect an income tax provision, since UWM (UWMC's accounting predecessor) is a pass-through entity not subject to federal and most state income taxes. For periods commencing with the first quarter of 2021, UWMC's net income does not reflect the income tax provision that would otherwise be reflected if 100% of the economic interest in UWM was owned by UWMC. Therefore, for comparison purposes, UWMC provides “Adjusted net income”, which is our pre-tax income adjusted for a 23.78% estimated effective tax rate. “Adjusted net income” is a Non-GAAP Metric.""

If one looks at the net income attributable to UWMC on the cash flow statement and then divides by the provision for income taxes, then that is an effective tax rate of 26.8% for roughly 5.7% of the float which is roughly the 6 percent of free float. What I am trying to say is that we only pay net income on the 6% of free float that is the Class A public float. The adjusted net income would be if the entirety of the company was taxed, which it isn't, so disregard adjusted net income as it's not GAAP. We'll assume a 25 percent haircut to income tax as a result (though it would be a higher haircut, I'm just lazy) which would give taxes of 9,664.

After accounting for federal and state taxes, the new net income would be 166,230,336. Net income and thus EPS is pre dividend income, but let's count the dividend before EPS and count it as part of net income for a truly catastrophic scenario. So, let's assume no share buybacks occurred (worst case scenario), we'd then remove 10,310,420.5 (.10\* 103,104,205). The new net income after accounting for dividends is 155,919,916. Please note that in accounting you don't calculate the net income by putting the dividend as a expense. I'm just doing this to give you guys an absolute shit tier scenario with revenue misses, no mortgage servicing rights increases and thus no mortgage servicing income and interest increases, no margin gain, expenses that do not decrease, a bit more tax than they'd actually pay, no shares bought back, and dividends as an expense and thus weigh down on net income and thus EPS. I did not count the interest expense on the new 700 million senior notes however. But it should come to roughly 31 million.

The EPS would be .097, so round it to ten cents. Account for the same EPS for Q3 and Q4. You get 30 cents. This is 30 cents without the dividend payout ratio since the dividend is already accounted for. We'll not include Q1. The dividend of 40 cents alone will net you a p/e ratio of 16.175. The actual EPS for you as a class A shareholder would be 70 cents for the period Q2 to Q4. That would translate to a P/E ratio of 9.24. If you count the EPS of Q1 (which is Earnings per share of .47) then the FY 2021 EPS would be .70 and the P/E ratio would be 8.64. But if you count the dividend of .40 in addition to the EPS then it becomes 1.17 and the P/E ratio becomes 5.52. The only reason I count the dividend is because the dividend payout ratio is literally .006 (.10\*.06=.006) per quarter. However, you're still getting ten cents a quarter on a stock that is 6.47 while retaining your economic interest in the company itself which is adding roughly 77 cents in EPS FY 2021 under a catastrophic failure of epic proportions scenario.

My positions: Roughly 7200 shares, and 49 7.5 call options for May (Those have taken a shit lmao). ",DD,0.91

CLOV,nrzisu,2021-06-04 09:49:55,CLOV joining Russell 2000 membership list today after market close. THIS IS THE CATALYST.,"Source: [https://research.ftserussell.com/products/index-notices/home/getnotice?id=2599440](https://research.ftserussell.com/products/index-notices/home/getnotice?id=2599440)

In accordance with Russell US ground rules, the reconstitution of the Russell US Indexes will take place after the market close on 25 June 2021. Performed annually, reconstitution ensures that the Russell US indexes continue to accurately reflect the current state of the US equity market and its market segments, including market capitalization (e.g., large and small cap), sector breakdowns, and style structure.

&#x200B;

# Timetable:

**Friday 07 May 2021:** Rank day. Russell US Index membership eligibility for the 2021 reconstitution is determined from published information and market capitalizations at market close.

&#x200B;

**Friday 04 June 2021:** Preliminary membership lists are published after market close. **This is the catalyst.**

&#x200B;

**Friday 21 May to Friday 11 June 2021:** Query period. Users are welcome to query the published data; any corrections will be communicated after market close each day. Merger and spin-off companies will be re-ranked when the transaction is effective between the rank day and the index lock-down. No further re-ranking will occur after.

&#x200B;

**Friday 11 June 2021. Monday 14 June 2021:** **Lock-down.** No further corrections will be implemented\* and the Russell US index reconstitution can be considered final (with any further changes to shares and free float isolated to changes associated with corporate events).

&#x200B;

**Friday 25 June 2021:** The Russell US reconstitution is implemented after market close.

Sundial has over $1 billion in cash, no debt, positive operating profit, and many valuable passive investments. 

The manipulation that the stock received was absolutely insane. Institutional ownership was less than 2% when SNDL made it’s run in Feb and the big boys didn’t want to miss the party and they paid motley fool to write bash articles while they accumulate their position. This is just my assumption, which is never a good thing when valuing stocks.

SNDL,nq36v4,2021-06-01 22:05:06,$SNDL 1$ Floor Established,"Hey Peeps,

Many of you are probably looking at today's price action as a WTF. I get it. I've been watching it periodically in ThinkorSwim. If you've been watching the level 2 you see the obnoxious bids / asks sitting between 1 and 1.02. Over150M (near 50% volume) shares traded hands at these prices.If you are checking the borrow rates [here](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/sndl), then you know the cost to borrow has gotten a bit more expensive as the day went on.

Personally I think this looks a lot like we have a solid $1 floor as the price line was tried 3 solid times, each time we broke the $1 line we saw a massive bid back up to $1. The shorts on SNDL don't have a lot of days to cover as shown [here](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=sndl&submit=Short+Quote). Short interest still looks around 15%. Nothing crazy, but has potential given any hype news.

The fact that the $1 floor seems to have held solidly is fantastic. Honestly I'm surprised. It has held the up channel very very well. Because of the lack of volatility (IV) you may have saw your options slightly decrease in value today. To me it was a good day to roll out my options. I took gains from the Jan 11 1.5s and rolled them into the Jan 18 1.5s on the drops near $1. I still don't meet the minimum for the side bar but I'm now the proud owner of 225 Jan 18 1.5 calls (just over 2k at my .09125 cost basis).

The rocket fuel here is the push towards Federal Legalization. Keep that in mind. I noticed a number of calls being written for $2 and $3 strikes today at the 18th expiration. That's a big move to hit that. I saw the $9 calls being written for Jul 16th. Again these are big moves, I'd stay modest in the 1$ - $2 range to be realistic.

This post will hopefully provide some value to people not familiar with Clover Health (CLOV) and their Medicare Advantage business. CLOV is starting to get a lot of attention because of the addition to the [MSCI index](https://app2.msci.com/eqb/gimi/smallcap/MSCI_May21_SCPublicList.pdf) in May, addition to the [Russell 2000](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf) index in June, and the [high short interest](https://fintel.io/ss/us/clov) that could lead to a squeeze. I personally invested in CLOV because of the fundamentals support a $15+ share price.  I'm happy to hold on to this long-term for that reason.

# Quick Fundamentals:

1. Revenue growth is [46% year-over-year.](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-full-year-2020-financial-results)
2. No debt. [700 Million cash on hand](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/08/could-clover-health-be-a-millionaire-maker-stock/)

4. Short Interest has only [gone up..  to 43%](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/nvedq4/clov_hedgies_increased_their_shorting_position/)
5. CEO & Insiders cannot sell shares until the price is 30$ for 90 days (Chammath predicted 100$)
6. Chelsea Clinton + [Demetrios Kouzoukas](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-appoints-trump-health-official-to-board-132343503.html) (former trump head of medicare) are on the board of directors - this is a big political edge.
7. Partnered with [Google / Alphabet](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/alphabet-backed-medicare-advantage-startup-clover-health-raises-500m/)
8. Small Float & High Short Interest means big price action is possible.
9. Added to MSCI Index in May, [being added to Russell 2000 Index on JUNE 25th.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/how-investors-can-play-the-rebalancing-of-the-russell-indexes-51590158778?fbclid=IwAR3KdSh-iHpTKI5gkxLZcGj52xkfbkhKwaKofCpRm084obCi4CTE3wt2uAA)
10. $70 Million worth of shares need to be bought for ETF's tracking the index.
11. **Price Target is 15 - 20$ fair value**.  Easy 2x with no squeezin.  Potential 10x

# Full Breakdown of CLOV Valuation

To understand what CLOV should be worth today, look at [OSH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSH/) and [AGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AGL?p=AGL&.tsrc=fin-srch). Not only did all three companies go public within the last year, but they are all similar-sized [Direct Contracting Entities](https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/gpdc-model) (DCE) competing for ""lives under management"" *(Note: you'll see companies report this number using the term patients, members, or beneficiaries. They're all equivalent)*. This term simply means Medicare patients that the company is financially +/- clinically responsible for. Medicare pays $850+ per beneficiary per month for these companies to take on the risk of managing their healthcare costs. You can think of it as a lower margin (5-10% EBITDA) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model that generates stable recurring revenue on a monthly basis for each patient being managed.

CLOV started out as a Medicare Advantage (MA) insurance plan, which is pretty similar to Direct Contracting (DC). That's because [the DC model was designed based on the MA model](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/cms-direct-contracting-model---is-it-still-one-of-the-value-based-models-built-on-fee-for-service-chasis-) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS launched the DC program in April 2021, and CLOV, OSH, and AGL among the first 53 organizations approved.

OSH does a good job of explaining how the Medicare Advantage market (and now the DC market) works:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t0utrzxkgp371.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68cd3b940c33b8c41e51c51cd270e8f7208cd8e

MA Plans are insurance companies that partner with specific healthcare providers to help manage the cost of their patients. The MA plan gets the $850+ monthly payment, and is [required by law to spend at least 85%](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare) of it on medical costs. They usually do this by giving 85% of the $850+ monthly payment to the healthcare provider, and thereby transfer the risk of unexpectedly high costs to the provider caring for the patient. The DC model works the same, except Medicare pays the Direct Contracting Entity (DCE) $850+ monthly. What's interesting about DC is that any type of organization can be a DCE. CLOV is an insurance company (MA plan) that creates networks of healthcare providers for their plan members. AGL is a Management Service Organization (MSO) that provides services to healthcare providers that care for Medicare Advantage patients. And OSH *is* a healthcare provider that operates brick-and-mortar clinics focused on Medicare Advantage patients.

Medicare Advantage represents [26 million Americans](https://www.medicareresources.org/medicare-benefits/medicare-advantage/), accounting for about 36 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries. The DC program was launched by CMS so that Medicare Advantage companies like CLOV, AGL, and OSH could help manage the other 46 million Medicare beneficiaries in order to transition away from fee-for-service healthcare. **It's a huge deal.**

Below I'll break down the key numbers driving the valuation of these three companies for their Medicare Advantage business. The DC business is obviously new, but I'll predict what the valuations will look like in DC afterward. **The most important thing to understand here is that the valuation for all three of these companies is the number of lives under management multiplied by a dollar amount. The dollar amount is the market saying how much they believe in the company's ability to profitably manage those patients.**

Disclaimer: I'm not saying all three companies should be valued exactly the same. I am arguing that the dollar amount per managed life should be within a much tighter window because the gross margin for managing a Medicare life (MA or DC) will always end up in a very tight window (5-10% of revenue) no matter what model you deploy.

**OSH = $14.3B market cap**

OSH is obviously liked the most by the market based on their valuation. It's partly because they run the clinics so they can keep more of the Medicare dollar (instead of splitting it with the healthcare provider that takes on the risk). Employing clinicians also allows them to theoretically do more to improve health outcomes and control costs. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% off the top, and the rest goes to OSH.

* **OSH gross margin = 6.7%** ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/osh/financials))
* **75,500 total managed lives growing to 112,000 this year** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **That's a valuation of $125,000 per patient**

**AGL = $14.3B market cap**

AGL holds the contract with the MA plan and then pays the contracted (not employed) healthcare provider. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% of the premium off the top, and the rest is split between AGL and the provider practices.

* **AGL gross margin = 7%** ([source](https://capital.com/agilon-health-ipo-will-the-stock-soar-in-2021))
* **165,300 total risk-based patients growing to 210,000 this year** ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-agilon-health-ipo/healthcare-platform-agilon-valued-at-about-11-billion-in-nyse-debut-idUSKBN2C22D7))
* **That's a valuation of $66,667 per patient**

**CLOV = $3.65B market cap**

CLOV has historically been just a MA plan, taking the 15% of the premium off the top and paying the rest to cover the patient's costs ([source](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare)). MA plans have an average profit margin of 4.3% after all their admin and sales expenses are accounted for ([source](https://mhk.com/medicare-advantage-is-the-golden-egg-for-health-plans/)).

* **CLOV historical gross margin (before COVID effect) = 2.5-4.1 %** ([source](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213))
* **132,000 total risk-based patients growing to 160,000 this year** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))
* **That's a valuation of $22,800 per patient**

**AGL is a good preview of how the DC market could be valued per Medicare patient, except the DC model could be even better. There is no MA plan taking 15% off the top in between the risk-bearer (Direct Contracting Entity: CLOV, AGL, or OSH) and Medicare. Direct Contracting patients could be valued as high as $76,667 (15% premium over current AGL patients).**

The CEO of OSH was recently quoted ""**the per-patient economics of that program will potentially be better than the company had initially estimated""** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))**.**

Here are the number of Medicare patients enrolled by each DCE (since the program launched in April 2021):

* **OSH: 6,500** managed lives ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **AGL**: **50,000** managed lives ([source](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001831097/98fb566d-8f47-4a36-bd48-6bef5745cf56.pdf))
* **CLOV: 65,000** managed lives ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))

Hopefully now those valuation ranges I presented at the top make a little more sense to you.

//

# Here's an outline of how the Clover Assistant (CA) platform improves treatment decisions and risk adjustment for the provider:

* **More informed doctors delivering better treatment and care**
   * CA will make treatment recommendations using evidence-based guidelines
   * Primary care providers manage so many different conditions, it's impossible for them to keep up with all the medical literature
   * CA will present the latest evidence-based guidelines as simple recommendations, so that the primary care provider doesn't have to stay up-to-date on the most advanced treatment pathways for every condition
* **More accurate documentation for higher Medicare payments (MA and DC)**
   * The monthly $850+ payment to MA and DC organizations is adjusted based on the patient's risk score (basically how many health conditions they have)
   * The risk score is calculated using diagnosis codes (ICD-10 codes) that are entered into the electronic health record (EHR) by the doctor and eventually included in the insurance claim that goes to the MA plan (and Medicare)
   * Providers often forget to include all the codes in the insurance claim, or even sometimes forget to properly document it in the EHR
   * Providers also forget to re-document codes on an annual basis, because on January 1 all of the diagnosis codes are erased in Medicare's risk score calculation because some diagnoses can change (e.g. cancer remission)
      * This sounds stupid, but if a diabetic patient has an amputated foot, Medicare acts like it grows back on Jan 1 and the doctor has to document the diagnosis again
      * Medicare is either too lazy to discern between permanent vs reversible conditions, and/or they like that they get to pay less for an inaccurately lower risk score
   * When providers forget to include one or more codes, that means the risk score will be lower and the premium received by the MA plan will be lower
   * CLOV's software analyzes data from the EHR as well as past claims to identify diagnosis codes that are missing from the current claim, and asks the provider if they still have the condition to see if the doctor simply forgot to document the code
   * CLOV's software also analyzes EHR and claims data to identify potentially missing diagnosis codes and asks the doctor if the patient ever had a certain condition using evidence-based guidelines
      * Example: blood pressure reading > 140/90 (threshold in hypertension guidelines) but no hypertension diagnosis code documented

&#x200B;

# 

# Why is CLOV Undervalued?

**Part 1: Hindenburg Report (February 2021)**

* Hindenburg does research for short hedge funds. The [report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/) revealed a DOJ investigation into CLOV that was previously undisclosed. The day after the report was released, an SEC investigation was initiated into CLOV based on the report. The report had a number of unrelated claims on shady marketing practices, undisclosed business relationships, and ""upcoding"".
* Probably the most serious accusation of them all is the one about ""upcoding"". If this is true, it's Medicare fraud. The number one rule in the Medicare industry is DON'T OVERBILL MEDICARE. In the case of CLOV, I seriously doubt there is any upcoding going on based on how their software works. The Clover Assistant (CA) software doesn't have the ability to change any codes. It just makes recommendations. The doctor has to manually do it for regulatory *and* patient safety reasons. There are other population health tools out there that do this exact thing. Often times when upcoding is being investigated, it's because the Medicare fee-for-service claims suggest a much lower risk score. However, that's because providers don't document most codes in fee-for-service claims because they don't get paid to spend the extra time. When the patient then enrolls in a MA plan or DC program, all of a sudden [their risk score shoots up](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170519/NEWS/170519815/doj-s-medicare-advantage-lawsuits-investigations-likely-to-change-insurance-culture) because the MA/DC organization and provider get paid based on risk.
* Regarding the other accusations, [CLOV released a point-by-point response](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521029637/d66346dex991.htm) the day after the report came out. I thought they addressed everything sufficiently. From an investor's perspective, it all comes down to what the DOJ finds. I'd be very surprised if Chamath's counsel and the third-party counsel involved in the SPAC ignored or did not look into illegal practices during due diligence. This was one of Chamath's first SPACs and he knew was launching many more. If you mess up due diligence once, the rest of your SPACs become worthless.
* **Regarding the BS about the CEO Vivek Garripali**, he bought 3 hospitals in bankruptcy and assumed their debt almost 10 years ago. He quickly found out why they were in so much debt. The health insurance companies offer such limited coverage and almost exclusively to high income neighborhoods. So, if their insuree visited a hospital or clinic or anything outside of their coverage area, the insurance company would refuse to pay the hospitals fees or only agree to paying a small portion. So the medical facility ultimately ends up assuming the debt and this eventually snowballs. Anyways. Vivek began charging these insurance companies high premiums on the accounts he could collect on in an attempt to make up for the losses for patients they wouldn't pay for. This is where they try and paint him as a villain. Long story short. He sold the the hospitals and created Clover Health in order to solve this corrupt problem throughout the health insurance industry. For his time and money invested. He didn't make money as much as he learned from this experience. So a big part of Clover's mission is offering widespread coverage to their insurees. These big insurance companies are hating this. Hence much of the hate for Clover.

&#x200B;

**Part 2: DC Enrollment Numbers (May 2021)**

* CLOV announced their initial Direct Contracting (DC) enrollment numbers in their most recent quarterly report. The 65,000 DC patients were far below the 200,000 that the market was expecting. There was obviously a miscommunication between CLOV and the market. CLOV stated they had *access* to 200,000 Medicare patients through their network of 1,800 providers using their software. Analysts took that as a projection of enrollment. They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time. My guess is they were able to do [claims-based alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) for much of the initial 65,000 DC patients, which is automatic. Now they have to market this program to the other $135,000 DC patients to get them enrolled via [voluntary alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) (i.e. consent). They could also market the MA plan which has more benefits. That's the power of CLOV having a network of providers contracted with its DCE and MA plan.
* This lower DC patient enrollment has now been priced in with analysts adjusting down to an average price target of [$9.33](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLOV/research-ratings). These price targets are based on extremely conservative enrollment projections and revenue projections from CLOV for their DC business.
* They set forecasts at 70,000 to 100,000 by end of 2021. *They already have 65,000 enrolled in April*. They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward. They also reported extremely low revenue projections for the DC patients. They're only projecting [$20M - $30M](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results) for the year.
* I would guess that their **profits** from the DC market this year could be $25M+ (5% margin x 65,000 patients x $850 x 9 months). Revenue should be similar to Medicare Advantage at $850+ per patient per month. That's at least $55M in Medicare payments per month for 65,000 DC patients.
* They did state that ""[GAAP revenue estimates for Direct Contracting are dependent on the finalization of accounting treatment, which we expect will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results)"".

**Part 3: Differentiation**

* CLOV does have a virtuous cycle built into its business. It's all based on their relationship with their provider network. When they contract with a healthcare provider, they give them access to the Clover Assistant (CA) for free. CA is a software platform that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) and claims data to provide decision support back to the provider at the point of care.
* The CA platform is a population health tool. There are competing software solutions in the market. The difference here is that the provider has to pay for access to those tools. CLOV pays the provider to use the CA platform. CLOV pays **$200** per visit, which is much higher than the average [$121.45](https://truecostofhealthcare.org/medicare_part_b/) that other MA plans pay.
* The reason that CLOV pays the provider to use it is because it improves the top and bottom line for CLOV. CA helps providers make better treatment decisions and document risk scores more accurately, which results in higher Medicare payments (to CLOV and the provider). Higher Medicare payments directly increases the top line revenue. Better treatment decisions lead to lower costs, which allows CLOV (MA plan or DCE) to keep more Medicare dollars. If you're interested in how CA works, I'll include some bulletpoints at the bottom of the post.
* **Happy providers are key to increasing the number of lives managed long term.** Providers are directly involved in the ""alignment"" process for DC enrollment, and their opinion is highly respected when making a recommendation around which MA plan a patient should choose. As CLOV grows its provider network, it will increase enrollment for both MA and DC. It will also lead to more CA software users, more software users usually leads to better experience and insights, which could reinforce itself and bring more providers onboard.

# Risks to CLOV

Below are the biggest risks I see for CLOV, in order of importance:

**1.** **DOJ Investigation**

As I mentioned above, I don't think there were illegal practices going on at CLOV that management, Chamath, or the third-party counsel were aware of. It's still possible the DOJ investigation finds something. This happens all the time in the Medicare industry, including to the biggest names ([UnitedHealth, Humana,](https://www.whistleblowerattorneys.com/blog/whistleblower-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud) [Cigna](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/doj-cigna-medicare-advantage-fraud-lawsuit/583023/), etc.).

All the MA plans learn from each other's missteps. CLOV has been operating an MA plan for over 5 years now. They were [fined $106,095 in 2016](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cms-fines-clover-health-for-misleading-marketing-tactics) for 'misleading' marketing tactics. *They haven't been fined since*. They have also gone through multiple rounds of funding from top venture capitalists and Google. There's been no shortage of due diligence on this company.

Yet, there is always the risk that someone somewhere was doing something illegal this time. If that is the case, it will likely end up in a lawsuit. I've seen many cases get to this stage and then get dismissed by a federal judge ([UnitedHealth 1](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/unitedhealthcare-medicare-advantage-fraud-suit-department-justice), [UnitedHealth 2](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/department-justice-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud), ). Worst case scenario for the company, there is a settlement. Here are examples of MA plans paying settlements for ""upcoding"" fraud cases:

* UnitedHealth (2017): [$32M](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/florida-insurers-pay-32m-to-settle-medicare-advantage-fraud-case)
* Kaiser Permanente (2020): [$6.3M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-63-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations)
* Humana (2021): [$12.5M](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/payer-issues/humana-roche-settle-false-claims-lawsuit-for-12-5m.html)

The largest settlement ever was [$270M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-270-million-settle-false-claims-act-liabilities) by HealthCare Partners (now part of UnitedHealth) in 2018. This was because the providers themselves were submitting false codes (not the health plan). All of these settlements are for ""upcoding"". Again, among all the accusations, I would be most surprised if CLOV was actually doing this. If anything, the Clover Assistant should result in better documentation around the codes because that's what it's designed to do.

No matter how cynical a view you want to take on the DOJ investigation, CLOV has no debt and $700M in cash from the SPAC proceeds, so a settlement should not significantly impact them.

**2.** **SEC Investigation**

The SEC investigation was announced the day after the Hindenburg report came out. The SEC is investigating whether the DOJ inquiries were material enough to require disclosure to the market. The investigation may not be closed until the DOJ inquiries have been resolved. If the SEC determines there should have been a disclosure, there will likely be a fine. I'm not an expert on SEC enforcement. The only thing I could point to would be the $20M fine Elon Musk paid for announcing a fake acquisition at a much higher price at the time. He picked $420 as the fake number, not sure why...

**3. Market Multiple**

Valuations based on profitability could be hurt in the short term. Medical costs are higher this year due to delayed care during COVID-19, so all companies in this space will have compressed margins in the short-term. I believe growth is more important than profitability in this market when you're looking at <1% of DC patients enrolled. CLOV has proven to be exceptional at growth and has proven it both in MA and now DC.

There could also be a general downturn in market sentiment, and these growth stocks with low margins would be affected the most. However, Medicare is a very stable business and these companies will continue to grow independent of economic conditions.

# The Meme-Stock Correlation, Short Interest, and Gamma Squeeze setup

To keep this short and sweet - CLOV was originally identified by WSB & Stocktwitters for the short interest being reported over 100% at one point.  This is due to several miscalculations but the idea is true that SI is not being correctly reported.  It is estimated to be over 50% but is reported around 40% on Ortex.  This has been the main area of interest in relation to meme stocks.

# How did CLOV get caught up in all the meme madness?

Well..  if you dont remember, back in January, chamath palihapitiya encouraged retail investors, along with elon musk, to buy and SQUEEZE GME + AMC.

[GME squeezes from 60 to over 150 the next day on this Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/quoosh9nup371.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0b3d8969d37920eee6947d97ac8585eaea345d)

[but this helped too](https://preview.redd.it/qucv5j9tup371.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e306406085ab9fc59d787bd3ab2381a52df689)

He made himself an enemy of hedgefunds who lost on these bets.  So when they doubled down their shorts on gme / amc - they went after chammaths stock, CLOV.  But they fucked up.  They doubled down and shorted it to shit because they lost money because of him.

With great fundamentals, **the short thesis is based on one thing alone - the HindenTurd report -** and guess what that is?  bullshit.

# 

# Did you mention Gamma Squeeze??

yes I did.   I even googled it for you apes.

https://preview.redd.it/9zj5oopi54471.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=61a66d109aec1738dece49345df43c974a18bc04

So basically, look at the **open interest** on each Strike.  Each new strike that goes in the money has to get hedged.  So basically multiply the open interest x 100 for each strike.  

[woops..  well we got them all in the money lol, so now we wait for shorts to cover... \(edit\)](https://preview.redd.it/is8dlv9ewp371.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8053c02d47b4b92c351b11b47875a53adb94cd9)

* Is a Gamma Squeeze possible?
   * Yes.
* is a Short Squeeze possible?
   * Yes.
* Will either of the above happen?
   * IDK.
* but someone paid to see the FINTEL short squeeze score, its 93 / 100

# TLDR:

* **Should be between 15-22$ at current valuation.**
* Clover Health is basically Medicare insurance for old people meets AI tech (the clover assistant for doctors) it’s a huge healthcare disruptor.
* They have 45+% year over year growth, zero debt, 700 mill in cash, 105% institutional ownership with a super low float..
* 30$ IS EXPECTED for the CEO to ever profit... and chammath said it’s a 10x in 10 years company.
* Shorted to oblivion by Hindenburg & short sellers who attacked this one in particular because Chamath encouraged amc / gme retail interest..
* Short interest is likely above 50% and it seems to have a gamma squeeze setup in the options chain.
* The short thesis is based on the HindenTurd report which is based on some 🌈 🐻 shit.

# CATALYSTS FOR PRICE ACTION:

* June 25. Russell 2000 index inclusion, will force 70 million in shares purchased for ETF's that track it.
* further discussion of reduced Medicare age or related
* public announcement Clearing of the DOJ / SEC inquiries.. ***this ones HUGE for fucking up the short thesis at its core...***
* future earnings & enrollment #’s, (every time they beat numbers will be great...)
* clover assistant updates
* I’m sure other things like great PR will eventually come out hopefully more from Chamath and the Clinton.

SNDL,nt0w9y,2021-06-05 19:32:56,The Bullish Argument for SNDL - Sundial Growers 🌱☀️,"Sundial Growers (SNDL) looks like a compelling buy at these levels, here’s why:

 1. They rose capital in February at $1.50 which traditionally acts as a floor for the stock.

2. Trades at 2x tangible book value compared to 12x tangible book value at cgc and acb. 

3. Had a nice high volume spike in February. It’s very common for the big mountain rise to come roughly four months after the initial molehill rise on big volume. We’re roughly 4 months from when the initial run up happened implying the Daddy run up could be near. 

4. Daily short volume remains very elevated with average daily short volume consistently around 50% although we were about 40% on Friday (which is still quite high) https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=SNDL Short interest is 13.78% as of May 14th implying shorts are shorting (selling shares they don’t own) in the morning and rebuying in the afternoon in hopes of spooking others out of their shares. This implies the short interest is quite underreported. If longs can hold strong and bring higher price action towards the end of the day these shorts are going to be overwhelmed with the sp, not to mention potential margin calls as SNDL increase it’s volatility and holding requirements. 
Once we see potentially see the automatic covering is when the party really starts 🎉

5. We had nice big volume up days of 622 million in May 28 and 894 million in June 3rd compared to Friday’s down day with only 372 million shares traded. Another bullish sign that the big volume days were also very green days while the red day was on muted volume. 

6. Stick with equity if you can. I predict the big institutions who are buying into SNDL are selling a boatload of options and ensuring the price stays under their expiration so they can collect premiums while lowering their cost basis. It’s happened the last two weeks. This can’t go on forever as the stocks price should match it’s value which imo is in the $4+ range (about 8x tangible book value) sooner rather than later. 

7. SNDL has only announced positive news and quality acquisitions since its peak in February with preferred debt and 19% equity stake in Indiva which owns many brands including the #2 gummy producer in the U.S. WANA Gummies. Sundial also acquired a large stake in The Valens at a deep discount compared to today’s price. Furthermore, SNDL acquired all of Inner Spirit which has the most retail cannabis stores in Canada at 80 stores. Sundial will undoubtedly replace current inventory with their own solidifying their strength as the only true vertical cannabis operator from growing, processing and extracting, to store front selling. As the industry continues to mature the margin increase Sundial will see is out of this world. Not to mention the free publicity from Reddit and Robinhood. For SNDL to consistently be a top 5 stock on Robinhood with a market cap of $2 billion is unheard of. The excitement around the stock will continue to help its real world performance. 

8. Sundial could very likely be acquired at any moment with 0 debt, over $1 Billion in assets including $900 million in cash. SNDL is a massive acquisition candidate at a fundamental level as it only trades at 2x book value with positive operating profit last quarter compared to CGC and acb which trade at 11x book value. 

9. As mentioned, Sundial had positive operating profits for the first time this quarter (primarily through passive security appreciation which shows no sign of stoping). If SNDL can continue the trend it will be picked up by more and more non weed hedge funds that require multiple quarters of positive operating profit before they can be incorporated. 

10. When someone buys potx or other weed etfs they automatically purchase 4.35% sundial and 5.6% of the Valens as those are the current weightings in the fund. Not to mention Indiva at a lower %. For every dollar that flows into PotX more than 10% goes to SNDL related companies. Every dollar that flows into weed funds in the future will help sundial. Imagine the money that will flow into weed companies and these funds once federal legalization is passed. 

11. The share count of 1.86 Billion is no more than Palantir or NIO which sit at 1.88 and 1.7 Billion shares, respectively.

12. SNDL currently has 4.79% institutional ownership compared to over 15% at CGC and acb. As time goes on this will continue to rise. It’s pretty normal for a developed company to have over 60%+ if not 80% institutional ownership, especially at a book value like Sundials. Book values traditionally act as a permanent floor for the stock, especially with SNDL’s positive operating profit and expected earnings growth and sales growth of 50% in 2022. 

13. The meme stock craze is not close to over. It’s just now being reported again on tv. Excitement is brewing and as normals continue and hear about it and get in, the avalanche should build higher than February’s peak. Sundial differentiates itself from the other meme stocks with it’s strong balance sheet and excitement around the up and coming industry. To me, investing in Sundial here combines level head value investing with the excitement of a new industry and the loyal meme craze. 

14. The new Sundial management team has been in place just over a year (Jan 30th, 2020) and seem to have remedied many of the operational mistakes of their predecessors (which is a main reason the stock was down from ipo price) https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/sundial-announces-departure-of-ceo-and-other-leadership-changes-and-optimization-initiatives-870988349.html 

15. They have a diversified acquisition strategy with new acquisitions in Indiva, The Valens and Inner Spirit which will lead to full vertical integration after the deals close in late summer (growing, processing/extracting and retail distribution). Sundial’s other investment holdings include: 100% ownership of Sprout Technologies, KamCan Products, 2011296 Alberta Inc, Sundial Deutschland, GmbH, Sundial Portugal, 2657408 Ontario Inc, NGBGA-BC Holdings and 50% ownership of Pathway Rx. They still have $1 Billion CAD in cash if the right opportunity comes along.

Hope some people found this background on the company helpful. Sundial seems to have a great runway to take off (fundamentally and technically) not to mention future catalysts like potentially breaking into the drinks market, as well as having many more medicinal and mental health uses. It’s undeniable that weed is losing it’s negative stigma and is way more popular in entertainment and social settings than it has ever been. Only a matter of time before you can order it at a bar or sporting event. It’s the trend of the youth and it’s just getting started. I’m here to answer any questions. Not financial advice.",DD,0.83

A combination of **high short interest, low float, increasing call volume** and **volatility expansion** (leading to IV expansion) will force Market Makers to delta and gamma hedge and shorts to capitulate themselves into a death spiral.

The IV expansion of all existing strikes will cause MMs to overhedge, **making the options market weigh more on the underlying market**, and as strikes become in the money the price action becomes a self-perpetuating feedback loop. In fact, Market Makers tend to LEAVE after meme-ification of a stock, **decreasing the float even more, destabilizing price resistance** while demand skyrockets.

The ultimate reason why this is a great fundamental play? **It's not even a shitty MEME company**. It has great fundamentals and is one of the greatest beneficiaries of our inflationary environment-- **the steel shortage is a powerful macro trend** that's increasing the cash flows and fundamental value of the company, and the leadership is one that will use this macro trend to reinvest, balance their balance sheets, and prime themselves to increase their dominance in the iron/steel industries.

DD,nmofz4,2021-05-28 05:12:37,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)","This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",DD,0.91

BB,nuou81,2021-06-07 23:59:53,Where can BB make it too besides the moon?,"I've been reading the BB tape for months. There is usually a very aggressive daily short position that takes about 20,000-40,000 shares after the open and keeps the price down. It generally stair steps the price down all day. It disappeared on the tape the moment it broke over 10 bucks. My guess is the big guys are ready to let the price start to sore. I doubt the real shorts went anywhere except for shorting at the top of key resistance levels.

If BB Ape buyers keep up the buying then BB could be sitting between extremely high historic levels at 42.49, 68.33, 85.32, AND 124.24 in a manner of weeks/months. Unlike AMC or GME, BB has historic levels to work off. That gives days traders and institutions a guide to trade and they will absolutely make those willing to take the risk a killing as this keeps going to their upper ranges. It will eventually be trading like the Internet of Things/Cyber Security that it is becoming before it monetizes and current buyers will just get in the ground floor and make some decent cash for their investment. When BB comes out showing that it has began to monetize the real accumulation phase will be over because the price will already be trading at the new ranges. Think TSLA, CCIV, etc. They all traded over their values highly and then fell back to earth before going back up. They whipsaw so that the big players can make money off selling high and buying low. Translate screw retail traders that buy high and then think its all over and sell low only to watch it rip again. 

My guess is that the sweet high spot of 85.32 is where BB will head to before a fall  for back to that 68.33 level. It will then  trade in range up towards 85.32 for a while. It will trade in a range for several months or up to a year or so before a rip beyond 85 to around the all time highs mentioned above as this becomes the new accumulation phase. The Prem Watsa's (Warren Buffett of Canada) will get BB to somewhere between the 70 and 80s before stepping off the gas and letting the shares fall back to no lower than the 20s-30s so they can acquire them again at a discount. Their motto is buy wholesale and sale retail. That is exactly what they did after the January surge. They bought every share they could at a discount and of course they sold some in the 10-20 range and will just buy more.

DD,nthp3b,2021-06-06 11:11:28,"DD RNG potential if compared with Hydrogen &amp; BEVs, USA (California) regulatory and legislative focus","Hello everyone, 

here a DD focused on RNG and Natural Gas developments in the USA, as previous one was more broad and had the intention to outline the state of the industry worldwide.

As you may know, California has always been at the center of attention as the most advanced state in terms of decarbonization efforts. Yet, it seems that not all decisions paid back in terms of quality of life and certainty of business activity.

**Californian** **Natural Gas power plants shut down, electricity imported from other states:**

Indeed, California, different from what someone would expect, has not a good and reliable supply of electricity, probably because it pushed too aggressively for the state's 100% electrification goal (see attached picture). During the most recent blackout in August 2020, some Electric buses were forced to shut down, in order to reduce electricity demand. In the next decade, virtual power plants' alike experiments will be more popular, therefore it is reasonable to expect a better match between the demand & supply of green electricity. But it will take time and for safety reasons, it would be better to rely on different sources of energy.

* [2020-08-21 Washington Examiner: California forced to defend green goals amid blackouts](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-forced-to-defend-green-goals-amid-blackouts)
* [2020-08-23 Oil & Gas 360 : Green California has the nation's worst power grid](https://www.oilandgas360.com/green-california-has-the-nations-worst-power-grid/)

The first question that arises, reading these topics, is about the never-ending announcements of companies like Nikola $NKLA (very dubious business potential) and Tesla $TSLA (amazing company with incredible potential) about the incoming, quick and easy electrification of Heavy Duty Transports.

**Hydrogen Alternative Focus**

Nikola revealed its lack of technological breakthrough when it was revealed that General Motors had the intention to market a Hydrogen trucks with the Nikola brand and...... GM Fuel Cells!! The drama related to the CEO trials made the rest. I am a huge fan of hydrogen , but as Cummins $CMI CEO confirmed, hydrogen trucks have a long long way to go before being adopted on a large scale (please note that [Cummins acquired Hydrogenics in Sept. 2019](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2019/09/09/cummins-closes-its-acquisition-hydrogenics) (second global leader after $BLDP in hydrogen fuel cells). According to Cummins and others, in the next years electrolyzer segment will grow first. Note that the hydrogen fuel needed for hypothetical trucks on California's road would need green hydrogen, thus it will put more stress on the grid.. Even if it is not focused on the US, I recommend readers this report of David Fickling about global green hydrogen potential by 2050. 

[According to David Fickling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-hydrogen-economys-time-is-approaching/2020/05/08/383b1a04-9191-11ea-9322-a29e75effc93_story.html), hydrogen could meet 24% of the world’s energy needs by 2050, but it would likely take 31’320 TWh of electricity to hit this level. Last year, the entire world generated just roughly 26’000 TWh, of which 10’000 were coming from zero-carbon sources. By 2050 it may be achievable, but there are shorter deadlines for the transport sector. Actions today are required to match 2025 and 2030 emission targets.

If we want a high percentage of **green hydrogen**, a huge amount of grid investments is required today; high-tension grid infrastructure needs 5-10 years to be completed, therefore it is reasonable to say that hydrogen will be a sound reality for mobility from the late 2020’s on, not earlier. In addition, the potential of exhausted salt mines that could store hydrogen for months is just theoretical for now.

It is worth to remember that the sources for electricity generation in Europe are diversified and are not ready for a 100% renewable energy scenario:

* **Germany renounced to nuclear power** in 2011 and will renounce to coal by 2030, and the country is massively investing in gas pipelines, so it is very likely that it will not renounce to Russian gas.
* **France relies heavily on nuclear power**, with some of these power plants being soon too old to remain active. Therefore, traditional gas generation will be a  likely alternative to overcome this problem.
* **The UK closed all its coal power plants** but decided to keep open nuclear and gas facilities.
* **Italy** relies heavily on gas and does not have any nuclear power plant.

None of Europe’s largest countries can afford a 100% green electricity sector that can satisfy both current demand plus the incremental demand coming from the green hydrogen sector. Therefore, some fossil fuel (natural gas) and nuclear plants are here to stay for the longer term.

**BLUE HYDROGEN CANNOT BE IGNORED -** The argument is different if we include in the discussion blue hydrogen along with carbon capture. In this scenario, we would need massive incentives and research investments in carbon capture technology, which now are still at an early stage. According to the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, [who spoke at the World Economic Forum in January 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/c93694c8-3d15-11ea-a01a-bae547046735), the EU will define the structure of a continental carbon tax by the end of this year (pre-COVID-19 intention, very likely now that the details will be published in 2021). For this reason, large trade partners like the US and China were advised to start their own studies on the tax, if they do not want their goods to be taxed at the highest possible carbon emission rate.

**HYDROGEN TRAIN FOCUS** \- An interesting case in this regard is the Hydrogen train developed by Alstom and Hydrogenics (now Cummins Inc.) whose adoption has been delayed considerably. Alstom was able to sell its innovative product to some German and French regions. Nevertheless, in most of the cases hydrogen will come from fossil sources (Rhyne region etc.), with cleaner alternatives being provided at a later stage. In the region of Schleswig Holstein, where the green potential was massive, Alstom could have got the greatest commercial order for a hydrogen product worldwide; however, the green fueling station was at the heart of a controversy between the company and the tender offer authorities of Schleswig-Holstein. For this reason, 52 trains were allocated to the battery train manufacturer and the Alstom (Hydrogenics) & NEL consortium lost the tender offer. The proposed fueling station was massive for the time, being around 20 MW capacity, [but the cost of it was at the expense of the consortium](https://www.ln-online.de/Lokales/Lauenburg/Aus-fuer-die-Wasserstoffzelle-auf-der-Schiene).

**BEV Infrastructure focus**

Tesla instead kept postponing the launch of its Tesla SEMI. You can read again the last conference call transcripts which clearly states that the biggest issue from a product perspective is the fast charger technology, whose time of realization and commercialization is yet unknown. From a macro perspective instead is unclear how California may afford to charge thousands of Tesla SEMI with its current electricity grid.

**How does $CLNE fits into all this?**

 If you look at 2020 Q2 CC of $CLNE , management made a quite useful comparison for H2 fueling stations and BEV charging stations for heavy-duty. They told the story of a recharging facility in Los Angeles that was going to be built for $5.5 million to recharge 24 heavy-duty trucks in a day’s time, in like 20-hour time, using the equivalent of the electricity needed for 44’000 homes (!!!). Thus, it is reasonable to expect not many fleet operators to switch soon to BEV trucks. 

About hydrogen refueling, management commented on the experience they got operating a hydrogen station in California with on-site hydrogen generation through electrolysis:

“*Get a load of this, it requires about 20 gallons of water (each gallon is 3.785 liters) for every gallon of hydrogen you produce. So march that out on a nationwide scale. And the idea that we're going to do it with renewable sources at a station is going to be very daunting, okay?*

*I think that as you look at commercial truck stops with hydrogen, you're probably looking at something on the order of $15 million to $20 million, or more, per station. So this is a very expensive proposition because you're basically creating a whole new network. And really, the most successful stations around the world, and there's only a handful of hydrogen, is you're reforming natural gas.”*

It is clear why some fleet operators are switching to Natural Gas Trucks. Amazon in February and the Port of LA recently, with the decision to equate BEV and other Zero Emission trucks to the Natural Gas ones. 

**US Congress ""Californification"" , not so fast**

In the past legislative period, there were some bipartisan attempts to support RNG and Natural Gas mobility. US Congress has indeed shown some interest in the subject. Last June, a bipartisan effort was introduced in both the chambers of the US congress. The bill is called “[Growing Climate Solutions Act](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/10/growing-climate-solutions-act-gives-farmers-a-seat-at-the-carbon-market-table/)” and would allow farmers to generate revenue streams from different forms of carbon capture. Most notably, methane from livestock is mentioned in the legislation. If enacted at  the federal level, decarbonized gas would receive a renovated interest from many different stakeholders. [Being a bipartisan deal](https://www.audubon.org/news/indiana-senator-mike-braun-discusses-bipartisan-climate-solutions-young-leaders), as farmers represent a prized electoral category, it should be enacted regardless of the next election results.

President Biden needs to show to his party and the American people that he is doing something about the environment. That is why he advertised the Ford BEV pickup and keeps saying that government's fleets will be electrified. As always, the political reality is much more complex than the headline announcements, and RNG has a lot of room to grow in this space. 

[Already in 2020, RNG represented 53% of all Natural Gas used in transport in the USA](https://bioenergyinternational.com/markets-finance/rng-surpassed-ng-accounting-for-53-percent-of-us-on-road-ngv-fuel-use-in-2020) . As noted in a previous DD, in California RNG is 90% of NG used in transport.

Let me know if you have further questions!

TLRY,nktkfy,2021-05-25 18:18:02,Legalisation of marijuana is proceeding. Possibly TLRY (Tilray) will explode soon,"The US House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in the US. Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Tilray's merger with Aphria paved the way for creating the world's largest cannabis company (by revenue). After checking out a lot about TLRY i was buying 1.170 Tilray-stocks today. I\`m sure this stock has really a lot of potential to explode completely.",DD,0.88

FORD,nhmv7n,2021-05-21 09:40:32,FORD DD - $F - Don't worry about debt,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

DD,nv8sfe,2021-06-08 18:56:44,WISH DD Part 2 (more pieces of puzzle),"# MODS ASKED ME TO MOVE Parts together, so Part 3 is copied again below.

&#x200B;

**P1:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqkzbc/wish\_institutional\_share\_increase\_with\_open\_puts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqkzbc/wish_institutional_share_increase_with_open_puts/)

&#x200B;

Hey, adding a part 2 for Wish DD since more information came to light.

**Summary of p1**: Hedge funds bought shares at a high and a boat load of puts. Stock got shorted down from $15 to $7.60 and the puts printed. They then averaged out their high bought shares. Shares increased from less than 100k shares to over 1million shares (times 2) for two examples mentioned.

&#x200B;

**Why part 2? Information that came to light:**

So on Finviz the last short interest reported was at 8% of the float.

Recently Bloomies terminal updated and now the SI is at 48% of float.

https://preview.redd.it/vff1du0hm2471.jpg?width=1009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f090821f5da533403f6410d8d7341cc0a8e96d27

Very critical in confirming the reasoning behind how the price got pushed down from $15 to $7.60 and a ton of puts were bought before the drive down.

&#x200B;

**Trading volume:**

The average trading volume for WISH is at about 5million, for the past two days we are seeing record highs of 50million in volume back to back. This is an indication that the floor has been met and there is absorption going on. The $7.90/$8 has rejected and Wish is now pointed upwards at the short sellers.

&#x200B;

**Price Targeting?:**

This is only a run up and since the shorts opened at $15 there is time for them to close with little to no losses espcially since the run up has been small. Given that the price dropped from $12 to $10 previously and the price today hit $9, the shorts who opened at $10 will start the covering. If the short squeeze from $10 rolls over, I do not believe $15 is the next level, it would be at $21. Reason being the past two absorption levels were at $20-$21.

&#x200B;

Edit\* Added float information

**Float vs Shares Outstanding:**

So the shares outstanding for Wish is around 600m but the last time the public float was reported at 300m. Today in the Bloomies update the public float is at 60m. With the float size decreased by so much WISH is super volatile, the price action might even break my $21 thesis since many less shares are exchanged and a short covering would require half the float to be traded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit\* the original tradeable float was 600mm-120mm lock up = 480mm

The current trading float is 60mm after the shrinkage.

&#x200B;

**Float Shrinkage:**

With a ton of institutional investors the float shrink probably means something was at work and the price was pushed down so shares can be bought up by someone else. Basically a buyback without shrinking the total number of shares in the market.

The plan to bring the price down to do the shady exchange have been caught with the pants down. Right now the pants are down and the exchange of shares is happening for control of the company. The shorts need to be covered and the float will need to hit shares outstanding again.

>! Possible price target $100. The normal float if 480mm shares exchanged in a day during a squeeze.!<

&#x200B;

**Verdict:** >!The rocket is in motion.  🚀 🚀🚀 and I like this stock!<

I believe I need to post part 3 separately since it's a whole other story.

Note: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice

I bring you part 3, the innerworkings of an under the table transaction.

>!The Art of the Deal!<

&#x200B;

**p1:** Shares shorted, puts bought, shares held gone up to ATH by hedgefunds

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqkzbc/wish\_institutional\_share\_increase\_with\_open\_puts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqkzbc/wish_institutional_share_increase_with_open_puts/)

**p2:** Bloomies updated, SI went from 8% to 48%, tradable float down from 300m to 60m

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv8sfe/wish\_dd\_part\_2\_more\_pieces\_of\_puzzle/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv8sfe/wish_dd_part_2_more_pieces_of_puzzle/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Why is Part 3 coming in so fast? **The puzzle might be solved and the pants are down.**

&#x200B;

Strange how the tradable float can go from 300m to 60m and institutional investors at 98%.

>!This only means one thing, something shady is going on!<.

Piecing the pieces together, the float shrinkage is due to shorting and an artificial buyback without actually reducing shares. The thesis is that there is a takeover of WISH shares and the prices was driven down with puts and shorts so the shares can be exchanged at lower price. The results of the shorting and exchange created a low float and now as the exchange is happening.

Right now, the stonk dealers got caught with their pants down mid exchange and the shorts need to be covered and the transaction completed at a higher cost basis.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The covering:**

Edit\* With such a low float of 1/8\* the actual real float this WISH squeeze might be yuge.

Low float  ✔️

High volatility  ✔️

High Shorts  ✔️

Bottomed  ✔️

Pants still down?  ✔️

I like this stock ✔️

A,njxv95,2021-05-24 15:22:58,"A DD on inflation, how it affects stock prices, and what it means for your investments!","**Preamble:** The current jump in US consumer prices has understandably spooked investors. The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let’s be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) – i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

”Money printer go brrr” was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn’t announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed’s explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow.

AMC,nrvwe7,2021-06-04 05:51:11,Serious Question for AMC apes,"To start, I'm retarded and don't understand anything.  I'm hoping someone can help me here, but it's unlikely given the avg. IQ of this sub.  Either way:

I was watching this clip from this spooge-stain Rich Greenfield [here](https://youtu.be/Z9-jJNjdfCs). He said something that kinda surprised me as he bitched and whined about how stupid retail traders are.  First, he said the volume of trades is in the billions, so it's impossible that we are all holding.  That's funny, it sounds like he said the quiet part out loud.

More importantly, he said, ""the fundamentals don't support the valuation"". I'm stupid and don't know that word, so I turned my head sideways to listen at these weird sounds.  He then brought up Cinemark, which he says is ""the exact same company"".  The only differences he uses to separate the two are (1) Cinemark ""has a stronger balance sheet"" and (2) Cinemark is a $5b enterprise value while AMC is at $30b.  

So this stupid ape did some stupid monkey math and 30/5=6.  So far, I think I'm okay.  Now I did more stupid monkey math.  CNK stock price of $23 X 6 = $138 for AMC.  That can't be right, as AMC is trading at $48.

Here is where I'm really retarded and know nothing.  I looked at Market Cap.  It's a number I see all the time and don't know anything about it.  I look at CNK market cap and it is $2.56b.  AMC's market cap is $18.85 muthafuckin billion.  18.85/2.56= 7.36.  7.36X$23/share= $169.  One 69, which is what my wife will give me if this is all correct.  

Help me please.  Tell me how retarded I am, this is.  Please tell me how wrong I am on the FUnDamentals.  Otherwise, I might go full retard and buy some $100 AMC calls with my wife's monnies",Discussion,0.7

**AMC**

(Bloomberg) -- Retail investors in India and South Korea have joined the meme-stock frenzy by piling into **AMC** Entertainment Holdings Inc. through local trading platforms giving them access to U.S. markets.

The money-losing movie-theater chain is among the five most-traded U.S. stocks over the past week on both Vested Finance and Stockal, two India-focused platforms for retail investors to buy U.S. equities. **AMC** Entertainment has accounted for 14% of trades on Vested this week, a greater proportion than Tesla Inc., Shopify Inc. and Facebook Inc.

**AMC** Entertainment closed 18% lower on Thursday after soaring 95% on Wednesday. Its dizzying surge in the past few weeks has pushed its market capitalization briefly above $33 billion. The craze for so-called meme shares such as **AMC** and GameStop Corp. is being fueled by pandemic-led lockdowns and low-fee trading plans that have encouraged new investors into global share markets.

“Due to social media platforms like Reddit, information today travels quickly across borders and an Indian investor is as plugged into the U.S. markets as their counterparts in the U.S.,” said Viram Shah, chief executive officer at Vested in Mumbai. “Some retail Indian investors are driven by news and want to be part of any global trends or movements.”

Sitashwa Srivastava, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Stockal, said that in the last three to five months, “people have been chasing high volatility stocks a lot more. GameStop happened, and now, AMC is of great interest.”

**Korean Favorite**

Korean investors snapped up $225 million of **AMC** shares from Monday through Thursday, according to Korea Securities Depository data. That total is getting close to three times the amount spent on the second-most-purchased counter, Tesla, at $82 million.

A popular online forum among Korean retail investors contained dozens of posts from traders known locally as “ants,” discussing the prospects for **AMC** stock prices, and whether Blackberry Ltd. might replace AMC as the next meme target.

I've said it before, and I'm saying it again... 

WELL Health is lining up to be the next CLOV. 

WELL Health Technologies (WELL) (WLYYF) 

*  20%+ Short Interest
* Raised $305M priced 30% above market led by the 29th richest man in the world. 
*  JP Morgan and RBC extended credit lines to over $500M combined
* Aggressive M&A activity that caused no dilution which now puts them as the largest clinic provider in Canada and expands footprint into the US through CRH Medical. 
* Nearly $500M in revenue with $100M in EBITDA 
* Fenwick & West Engaged for a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year - Fenwick did literally every big name from FB and AMZN to COIN and is extremely exclusive. Likely that they selected WELL. 

By no means am I saying CLOV is a bad company I really like them both but WELL just seems like a situation where the market hasn't caught up to the fundamentals and I think it's just a matter of time now. 

I mean look at this... A year of consolidation while the company has exponentially increased the business offering. Time for the chart to do the same 🚀🚀🚀

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Nikola = your wife's boyfriend

This number is now 44.47% (courtesy of ORTEX), this puts it just one place behind CLOV which passed it yesterday. While I'm still not 100% certain on the longevity of the company yet until I see more progress, short term I think this thing has plenty of room to run in the current market. Also, this bad boy has seen numbers like $40+ and I'm confident if momentum picks back up this thing can get back up to the $20+ range.

Currently I own June 18th $17.5 calls in anticipation for this thing to blow the hell up. All this thing needs is more exposure and it will literally go through the roof. There is information going around the $WKHS owns 10% of $RIDE and that $WKHS should go down with it as well. Initially, I thought the same thing until I did a little more research and found out that $WKHS owns part of $RIDE through a licensing deal where $RIDE paid $WKHS $12 million dollars in exchange for intellectual property and 10% stake in their company. This isn't something that $WKHS paid cash for, its basically free stake in that company.

Dear retards,

Today  I was doing my DD’s and while doing my wacc, roe and other bullshit  analysis I had the smart idea to have a look at the Short Interest of  sndl.

While looking at it I was  astonished by the data reported by Bloomberg terminal. Our  short-interest ratio is 1.44, while amc is only 0.53 and gme 1.45  (source: Bloomberg terminal).

This means that the number of shorted shares is 1.44 times higher than the average trading volume which is absolutely crazy!!!!

The  percentage of the float is around 15%, however, the data of float  percentage has not been updated yet. IMO we could easily be at around  20, as gme and amc.

The main thing differentiating us from AMC and GME is the SI Score provided by Bloomberg terminal à 2nd

amc is just 5th whereas gme 4th

To conclude the S3 rate temperature, indicating the seasoned financing levels with 1, 50 or 100

1= Liquid borrows typically indicating a short interest at or below historic terms

50= Marginally higher borrow levels typically indicating somewhat elevated short interest

100= Increased borrow levels typically indicating elevated short interest.

We  are currently at 50, ( gme stands at 1 (source Bloomberg terminal)) and  even in this case, the data have not yet been updated from the previous  month….

The SQUEEZE is near we all need to hold sundial !!!!

Cheers and have a good day y’all degenerates

BB,npa7k6,2021-05-31 20:39:25,$BB - Unbiased Technical Analysis,"***TL;DR -*** $BB's candle on Friday was ugly and the volume was not supportive of the trend. In order to see more upside - we have to clear this resistance at **11.86.** Above there, it's full speed ahead. 

There is key support at **9.84** and **8.71** \- if you are one of the people long right now hoping for a squeeze - it may be in your best interest to stop out below one of those (daily close).

\-----

Fully prepared to be downvoted to shit for not going along with the group think - but for those who are more focused on making money than catering to their bias - I figured I would give a little $BB roadmap.

This one is not nearly as simple as my previous plays. We are already in the middle of the breakout. We've also **already hit the primary target** I had for said breakout.

From here - we need to look at key supports and resistances to determine whether there is good odds for more upside.

First - let me review the breakout in question:

[$BB 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/19nhc3d71i271.png?width=2244&format=png&auto=webp&s=04bad77e41550e92a0c48c296b07d5f063009f9f)

Here you can see we were stuck in a descending channel from Feb 2nd\~ until May 25th. This is the exact same setup as many other meme stocks. 

After breaking said channel - along with a lot of the other names of this nature - we broke our first key level @ **9.84** with nice volume - and then followed through further to **11.86 -** the far target for this move. Overall - it was a fantastic play and generated some nice profits.

However - **Friday's candle was not pretty -** long wicks like you see there on the top end on a red candle are generally a bad sign for bulls - although I'm not crazy about candlestick reading. It's just one data point. More importantly - we closed lower than we opened with a huge increase in volume. This is often a sign of a major top (or bottom if the role is reversed). 

You can see a similar occurrence on **12/1** \- as well as **1/26** \- although the volume was much higher. Again - just another data point - but one you want to take note of. Every TA post I see here is pretty much people just cherry picking indicators that fit their bias - and that does no one any good. If there is one thing I know - **it's that if you go looking for confirmation bias - you will find it.** Be careful.

Now - let's take a look at the bottom line - **the data that we can actually put into practice, levels:**

Very key support is sitting @ **9.84** \- below that, **8.71.** If we lose the first one, it's not a great sign for momentum. If we lose the second one, I wouldn't go anywhere near this thing.

Now - **for the bull case:**

We have very key resistance @ **11.86 -** if we got a daily close above there, we would rocket straight to **14.37,** maybe even **15.72.**

How I would play this:

Enter long on a **daily close above 11.86 -** target **14.37** take half my position off - set a trailing stop loss on the other half and shoot for **15.72** if volume is supportive.

You always want to let the plays come to you - it's not good to force things.

*Not Financial Advice*

---

Update: Solid close today - memes are rangebound/in no mans land currently chopping back and forth - but potential for crossing that 11.86 tomorrow. The fact that we did not lose 9.84 today was a good sign.

Range is 11.86 - 9.84 looking for a break either way.

Small caps also broke out (RTY) which is great for meme names.

As I type this we are going over 12.10 -

CLOV,nunagh,2021-06-07 22:53:38,$CLOV &amp; $DNMR Flash Buy Signals,"One tried and true method of deciding when to buy—and when to sell—is to watch the charts. Clover Healthcare (CLOV) and Danimer Scientific (DNMR) both flashed buy signals in the past few days. Both companies are the target of Short Seller attacks and law firms soliciting customers to join shareholder lawsuits. The good news is that both CLOV and DNMR are rebounding, and I think this is just the beginning. Both are well off their 52 week highs, and both have a long way to run.

One of the simplest methods for new investors to answer the question of when to buy is to watch the Simple Moving Averages (SMA). When the 5 Day Moving Average crosses the 30 Day Moving Average going up, it’s a buy signal. 

Using this method, AMC gave a buy signal on May 13th, when the stock closed at $12.98. We all know what happened after that.

https://preview.redd.it/6p6b9786ow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf9859bdf9aae55e8c9789b566e21e2231460f85

This method isn’t foolproof. It will give some false buy and sell signals, and by definition you won’t catch the high or the low, but it will catch major up and down trends.   


**$CLOV gave a buy signal on June 3rd, when the stock closed at $8.90**  
CLOV also gave a false buy and sell in May, essentially selling it and buying it back at the same price.

https://preview.redd.it/7y4x7t5cow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7350ae99bd09b9121e359dd44801208114c36cbd

**$DNMR gave a buy signal on Jun 1st, when the stock closed at $21.88.**  
Following this signal with DNMR, you would have had a false sell and buy signal in Feb and Mar, but you would have sold it at $37.90 on 3/25, preventing a long, painful ride down before it bottomed out at $15.38. Selling it at $37.90 and buying it back at $21.88 would also let you buy back more shares. 

https://preview.redd.it/n75xpi6kow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bae3f68eb5c966cf9fe8a9526d7d1b4fc64409a

Even with the occasional head fakes, this signal catches the long term trends up and down. I think it’s another useful datapoint to double-check your investment decisions.  
 

**Support and Resistance**  
 As another datapoint, both CLOV and DNMR are above most of their moving averages. CLOV is above its 30, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages. DNMR is above its 30, 50 and 200 day moving averages, but still below its 100 day moving average.  
 

**CLOV**  
 30 Day SMA: 8.30  
 50 Day SMA: 8.19  
 100 Day SMA: 9.61  
 200 Day SMA: 10.55  
 

**DNMR**  
 30 Day SMA: 21.61  
 50 Day SMA: 26.06  
 100 Day SMA: 34.60  
 200 Day SMA: 23.90  
 

**Fundamentals are Strong**  
Both $CLOV and $DNMR have fundamentally strong businesses in the early growth stage. Clover is a small, growing healthcare company with proprietary software. Danimer Scientific makes biodegradable plastic resin, and is aiming to address the single use plastic waste crisis. I believe both companies have bright futures, with sales and earnings expected to continue climbing in the years ahead.  
 

**Short Interest**  
This isn’t the reason to buy, but it may be icing on the cake. According to Marketwatch, CLOV has 35.8% of the float shorted, well above GME (21%), AMC (18.93%) and BB (9.0%). DNMR has 15.8% of its float shorted. (I realize this varies from day to day and site to site)

**CLOV: 35.8% of Float Shorted**  
**DNMR: 15.8% of Float Shorted**  
 

**Summary**  
 I believe CLOV and DNMR have bright, promising futures, and I expect them to gain both short term and long term.

Alright smooth brains. You might've seen this weird little ticker called CLNE picking up some steam around here and wondered why. Back in March/April there was a very solid DD done about why this company is poised to grow. Will post link in comments 

However there's been a couple of things that have happened since then that turned this from a solid play into a potential gamma squeeze based off OI that won't send us to the moon...but to Saturn!!! 🪐 🪐 🪐

Amazon (yes that Amazon), made a deal with CLNE to fuel their trucks....and the best part? THEY ALSO AGREED TO HAVE THE OPTION TO BUY 50 MILLION SHARES (about 5%) AT $13.49 PER SHARE. EDIT: As /u/dazedstate pointed out I completely forgot to add that they ingeniously built their fuel stations next to Amazon warehouses. 

The stock has low daily trading volume. This allowed certain institutions to hammer it down and keep it there (You know which ones they are). But it's also very easy to push around. How easy? Nrdrage was able to send the price up $1 by himself for under 250K as a demonstration.

The Median PT is $20!!!! that's literally double what it is right now!


SO WHAT ABOUT THE GAMMA SQUEEZE?

Based off that DD the OI for June 16C's @13 has reached 25.22K!! This stock has low volume so 2.5 Million shares reaching ITM would send it shooting up even further. Okay but the average volume is 6M...how does 2.5 million in the money drive it up? Because there would be so much demand at one strike price that there wouldn't be enough stock available at that price which would result in HF's and IB's having to do sweep orders to make up for all the calls they sold.....for those of you with more than one wrinkle... that means the price would keep going up and up until they had enough shares to cover their calls!! And once it hit's that level there's so much momentum it'll keep sky rocketing!!

Here's a chart for those of you who like crayons. (In comments)

Thanks to some apes today it has broken out of consolidation. It's tough to see on the chart but the 3EMA has crossed the 8EMA also (stock go up).

Yesterday there was a tremendous 12% gain and shares have traded on significantly higher than average volume this past week. We are potentially seeing some firms get cold feet and begin to cover, and there is clearly a significant amount of big money ready to move fast here.   
Look at yesterday, when the shares jumped nearly 10% in a matter of minutes. Clearly someone wanted out of their shorts. Could we see more this morning at open? I’d rather lose money and see this go into the sand than miss out on some serious tendies.

Beyond these diamond-strong technical assumptions, this is really a great company. A few weeks back, SOFI purchased a no-name community bank to obtain a national bank charter, which will give an enormous boost to margin for the fintech when combined with it’s SPAC business.   
Seeking Alpha also estimates significant growth - ""SoFi already forecast massive growth in adjusted EBITDA with the company ending 2025 with \~$1.2 billion in EBITDA. The fintech forecast a nearly $300 million boost to those EBITDA targets due to the lower cost of capital leading to increased NIM from holding loans longer and growing lending amounts.""

BB,ntf8df,2021-06-06 08:16:40,$BB ideas for Monday,"Disclaimer: I got out from $BB on Friday.

$BB dropped below $14.30 (50% Fib Retracement mark). This mark was tested and rejected multiple time from Thursday through Friday. However at around 2pm $BB dropped bellow. Bulls immediately tried regaining this level but got rejected and we closed below. The next level is 61.8%, $13. Bulls must hold this one in my opinion. There's a big hole that is still unfilled when $BB gapped up from June 1st to 2nd. If $BB goes below $13, then we might retest June 1st closing of $11.56 and 78.6% retracement mark of $11.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Pv2AQcyz/

Volume on Friday also wasn't great. Comparing it to Thursday is a bit unfair since that was a record breaking day. That being said, Friday volume was a half of what it was on Wednesday. This was also $BBs first negative day of this run. Looking back to January, first negative day of that run also coincided with lower volume and that was basically the end of that run. Volume was keep decreasing since that day going forward. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/onHdg7BE/

On Monday:

* If $BB opens above $14.30, it will most likely try and retest 50% retracement again. If we hold above, might be a good place to jump back in. 

* If $BB opens between $14.30 and $13, just wait and see, that's noman's land. If $BB starts to slide then I'm looking for a strong rejection at $13 before even thinking about jumping back in. If we go below $13, then there are good chances we'll retest $11.5 and $11 marks. If $BB starts the morning strong and goes up, watch what happens at $14.30. Going above and stabilizing that is a good sign. 
* And of course I'm looking for better volume than last Friday if there's to be continuation of this run.",DD,0.79
UWMC,nd9hyr,2021-05-15 23:56:15,"UWM Holdings Looks Like a Value Bargain With Low PE and Attractive Yield UWMC stock is worth $10 per share, 36% over its recent price at 8 times forward EPS","UWM’s new buyback program. On May 11, UWM said it would repurchase up to $300 million of its shares over the next 24 months. This is a sort of dividend to shareholders.

With its $12.8 billion market cap, the $300 million represents a 2.34% buyback yield to shareholders (i.e., $300 million/$12.8 billion) over two years. This is also worth 1.17% annually, or 13.6 cents per share.

Add that to the 5.25%dividend yield (i.e., 40 cents annually divided by $7.68). So the “total yield” as I call it, is worth about 6.42% (i.e., 53.6 cents divided by $7.68). At $10 per share, the total yield is 5.36 % annually more appropriate valuation.

As there are about 1.605 billion shares outstanding, the adjusted EPS will be $1.16 per share. At the recent price of $7.38, this puts UMVC stock on a forward P/E of just 6.4 times forward earnings. That is very cheap.

My estimate of $1.16 is close to analysts’ estimates, as seen by Seeking Alpha, of $1.14 per share. They also estimate $1.23 for next year. That puts UWMC stock on a forward P/E of just 6 times earnings.

I believe a more appropriate valuation is 8 times earnings. That puts the value at $9.84, or roughly $10 per share. This is a potential 36% gain for UWMC stock.",Discussion,0.86

ASO,nqrn5c,2021-06-02 19:45:56,ASO - Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors -- Gear up for 6/8 Earnings🚀,"This is my first ever DD so sorry if it is shite.

Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO🚀🚀🚀)  is a brick and mortar Sporting Goods and Outdoor retailer that is CRIMINALLY Undervalued right now. They have a Strong Buy Rating on Yahoo Finance with an Estimated 100% return on tendies. Additionally they have a Strong Buy Rating from Zach's.  I believe their upcoming earnings 6/8 will be monumental and they should be delivering a brinks truck to your driveway...

**Recent Events**

ASO just recently paid down over 99Million Dollars in debt. This will save them an estimated per year 9Million on interest alone. In Addition the S&P Global has increased their credit rating to a B+ from originally a B.  Academy has been trimming the fat and becoming more lean in the retail space--setting themselves up to deleverage debt and enhance growth opportunities.

Currently they are trading at a P/E Ratio of 10.72, this represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.98. 

**Competitors**

Dicks is one of ASO's largest competitors. During their earnings report they announced a crushing of earnings, this is resulting from primarily their ecommerce, in store purchases opening up and yes you guessed it, GUNS. Their share price after earnings announcement jumped from roughly $84 to $98. I see ASO moving in a similar pattern, expecting to CRUSH earnings with ammo, guns, retail, and ecommerce trading. With the pandemic in the rearview, anecdotally I was in there this past weekend, and grills, outdoor gear, and other items were flying off the shelves.

**Short Squeeze? (jk)**

One thing that is interesting is according to Yahoo Finance the Short % of Float is 26.06% with 93% of Shares held by institutions. (Melvin?)

**TLDR**

Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) is undervalued in terms of fundamentals, I believe this next week's earnings report lead to all signs of them crushing it, which will in turn make Apes rich and those shorts eat shite.

My opinion on the ""Non-Controlling Interest"" line of the Income Statement and why Dan Gilbert could send this stock to the stratosphere in 3 seconds if he wanted to turn hedge funds into hobos for shorting this stock","Hi all, I'm back with a dive into the financial statements into what exactly this line highlighted below ""Non-Controlling Interest"" (NCI) is. and why it appears to take away so much of the Net Income before ""Net Income attributable to Rocket Companies"". In this screenshot below the amount of NCI is about 97% of Net Income. If you look at the most recent quarters the NCI is about 93%. Regardless of what it is RKT is slated to deliver 2021 EPS of around $2. Positive earnings for a company trading at a 9 P/E ratio (as of today) should be doing much better in this stock environment regardless of the NCI impact yet RKT continues to trade below it's fair value of a minimum $40 per share based on a 22 P/E ratio valuation which is the standard for S&P. Regardless of all that, what the analysts are failing to discuss is this company is INSANLY profitable and can turn way higher EPS by the snap of it's fingers by decreasing the NCI. A mere 3% decrease could triple EPS. See my next screenshot for what the NCI is.

[screenshot per RKT 10k](https://preview.redd.it/oacouksut4471.png?width=1641&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0428fd23135785caeb6074397f3140762b0310)

The screenshot below describes per RKT annual 10k that RHI is a partnership owned 94% by  Dan Gilbert. This is also referred to as the class D shares that I have seen many other intelligent apes discuss. These class D shares give Dan and the C-Suite sweeping control over 70% of the voting stock giving them free rain to dictate the company as they see fit. In some cases this could be bad but in the case of RKT I see similarities to early day Amazon in the sense that 1) they are determined to take market share at whatever means necessary to win long term and 2) they actually have the ability to be insanely profitable if they choose to be but continue to reinvest the money in growing the business (i.e. their big marketing campaign we've all been seeing on TV).  Getting back to my point now on the 3%. If Dan Gilbert were to sell his shares (EDIT UPDATE) SELL HIS SHARES BACK TO THE COMPANY (i.e retire the shares decreasing shares outstanding making them treasury shares). This would then lower NCI while increasing EPS.

To summarize my two points RKT can triple their bottom line EPS by two easy ways if they wanted to 1) stop taking market share and deliver stellar earnings or 2) Dan can retire a mere 3% of his class D shares to squeeze every short out of their boxers.

I personally find this very compelling case to own shares of this company as they have proven they want to continue to grow top line revenue as best they can in the mortgage space before they begin to maximize profits. If either of these two events above occur on a fundamental basis would triple the EPS and therefore even at current P/E ratio valuation of 9 would send the stock up to $60 if their P/E would drop to 3. If the stock begins trading at S&P valuation levels of 22 P/E ratio it would be around $120 per share without considering the other revenue streams growing by triple digits.

Bottom line: On a fundamental analysis looking at RKT it makes no sense why the stock is trading at the levels it's been at the past month. The bears are losing their only case now that the 10 year yield has fallen as you can see by the big gains these last few trading days. I appreciate all of the other analysis done on a technical level by the other apes. From this apes perspective we are clear for lift off on a fundamental financial statement basis to get to the moon and maintain orbit.  🚀🙌🏼💎

AMC,ntvotn,2021-06-06 23:08:22,$AMC and $GME Are Going To Cycle through Dips And Peaks This Year.,"Both stocks are a battleground in the war between retail and institutional investors.  The reason why there will be a lot of money made against short sellers this year is due to what the actual outcome of this battle means.  The battle is who gets to control the narrative in the market.  That's far more valuable than the actual fundamentals in any of these investments.  The value of both these stocks now balances on the fact they are ""battleground stocks.""

AMC and GME were slated to be windfalls for short sellers and predatory investors.  Major Hedge Funds keep taking stupid losses on these stocks because they need to be right.  If they aren't right then the narrative is broken.  So they can't continue a cycle of targeting stocks they want to crash and profiting off the panic they generate.  If retail dictates the narrative then being able to short sell a stock down to nothing becomes a lot harder.  Analysts actually have to study companies intensively and follow market sentiment rather than justifying their sentiment and engineering the falling share price.

So yeah I would hold forever.  Because maybe you FOMO this time around and end up holding the bag.  But we have seen several spikes this year, so next go around you find yourself profiting.  We have seen multiple billion dollar losses reported by hedge funds.  It's easy to suggest that these funds are coming back in to closely watched stocks, trying to short and getting caught.  So we see squeezes and general excitement over serious money being on the wrong side of these stocks.

So not a financial adviser, just a retard.  But yeah I'd hang in, buy during dips and hold until you're happy to profit.  We are going to see AMC and GME fought over all year because the precious narrative is at stake.",Discussion,0.85

Don't get me wrong - I have shares in BB and would love it to moon, but the amount of AMC/GME FUD going on from new accounts where 100% of their post history is pushing BB or fucking SILVER is blowing my mind. That shit's not organic and we see through your bullshit. Again, I say this as someone who's been holding BB since January.

Just make a Daily Megathread for each of these four stocks and call it a day.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:

/u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR/ - check the comments of literally this very thread. Tons and tons of random-ass comments just being like ""SLVR 🚀🍝🍕👌💕🚀🚀"" (insert your own bs pump n dump ticket). Their comment history isn't organic, they're not even remotely on topic, accounts are new as fuck, and they never post in other subreddits. I get that admins/mods are limited in what they can practically do - what I'm saying is that the current automated daily thread solution just doesn't work. Bots and employed accounts can literally just spam distraction tickets all day to hijack the daily threads.  


EDIT 2:  
SLV wasn't being specific - pay attention to the part where I said ""insert your own bs pump n dump ticket"". It was meant to be a point re: what short sellers were obviously trying to do in the winter.",Discussion,0.86

CLOV,nvi64u,2021-06-09 01:51:30,Our Four Leaf $CLOV 🍀,"Dear Apes, I'm writing to you today to tell you a few things. I see many people not understanding and wanting to. A lot of people spreading misinformation, etc. I want to clear the air and inform you, crayon eaters.

Welcome to WSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit, the home of the Apes 🦍. We collectively are considered one of the largest hedge funds in the world. There are many baby crayon-eating apes who are eager to eat some tasty bananas 🍌. Many of you question how any of us make money, so please feel free to ask questions 💬 in the comments as I will be answering as many as possible, although keep in mind I am not a financial advisor, I simply love the stonks.

**The main topic and example today is $CLOV.** You've most likely been hearing a lot about it. Let me explain the hype behind our four-leaf clover and what you need to expect and do to make some crispy chicken tenders (currency).

$CLOV is a very shorted stock currently with an approximate short float of 50% (please correct me if I'm wrong). A short in simple terms is when someone bets on the stonk going down in value. They 'borrow' the stonk at $50, and give it back to the lender at the lower price of $20. Profiting $30. But here's the catch. If they 'borrow' the stonk at $50 and it going up to $100, they must buy the stonk at $100. Which will raise the price of the stonk. Make sense?

**Good. Now, what causes the short squeeze?** Truth is many factors. WSB as a whole usually rally around certain (meme) stonks that are either undervalued and/or highly shorted. Once we do it causes a jump in price. The shorts wet themselves from a gamma squeeze (high volume trading from Apes dumping all tendies into a stonk). This causes them to eventually have to pay back their shorts at a ridiculous price and in turn, causes the stock to go up.

**What is the perfect recipe?** Well, because it's so highly shorted and we have a ton of Apes hoping on the stonk going to the moon, they've bet on it. Opening many contracts on the four-leaf clover. Once the price reaches above a certain value, many will 'exercise' their contracts (which means actually purchase their shares at the 'strike' price they set it to. Causing a huge influx of shares to be taken at once.)

**Is it too late to purchase $CLOV?** No, it's not. Is it going to go up? It depends on us. If you hold, the shorts will need to pay those bananas back to us at a higher price. Did you get it too late? If you purchased below $25 so far, you will profit if you hold. $CLOV isn't as much of a meme stonk as you think. They have great fundamentals and actually are a great business. So everyone that has purchased, don't worry. You'll profit if you hold. What you're seeing now is only a gamma squeeze caused by us, and everything is going to plan.

**What will the price hit? When do I sell?** Good question, no one ever knows. But I can tell you personally, this will hit $50 no problem. The stonk market is a scary place. There is always a risk, but this risk, for now, is limited.

**Did I miss out? Should I buy it now?** It's up to you, I'm not s financial advisor. Personally, I'm doubling down tomorrow at open, no matter the price. So do what you must with that information.

To all of those stuck on AMC and GME. This is not for you. This is also not a distraction from either of those. Feel free to go with your gut. What I'm telling you, is there is tons of opportunity here, and there will be enough tendies for everyone.

Apes, stay calm, follow the drill. I wish every single one of you, the best of luck. 🍀 After all, we have the $CLOVer on our side. 👍

AMA 🗣️

Edit: On June 18th many options contracts expire. So expect tons of movement in the coming days in an upward trend. Expect price drops a day or two before June 18th as paper hands try and exit. Don't fret, it will go back up. 🎢 Also, NO SHORTS HAVE COVERED THEIR POSITIONS YET. This means this hasn't even begun yet. The next few days will be interesting.

Edit June 9th, 2021: Some may be very worried about the price dropping a tiny bit. This is something that happens with stocks. I call these types of fluctuations routine. I personally will continue to hold as it's clear that these fluctuations are perfectly natural and healthy. For me, there is absolutely no reason to sell or even worry. Good luck out there to all!",Discussion,0.69

DD,nqxmty,2021-06-03 00:02:22,The Weekly DD - Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Rise of The Gamers," The video game industry has taken off since the pandemic and is expected to reach a value of \~**$290 billion by 2026**. How does this compare to the global box office industry? From 2019 to 2020 we saw revenues shift in the following:

**2019 -> 2020**

*Global Box Office*

\~42 billion (all-time-record) -> \~11.5 billion

*Gaming Industry*

\~152 billion -> \~164 billion

That’s right, in 2019 (pre-pandemic) the gaming industry was already over 3.5x the size of the box office entertainment industry and over 14x in 2020\*. Gaming’s 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined ([source](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/video-games-2020-revenues-outpace-movies-sports#:~:text=A%2520new%2520report%2520from%2520MarketWatch,both%2520movies%2520and%2520sports%2520combined.)).

https://preview.redd.it/lzt4hta5dx271.png?width=3999&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4262f1ce48f2cdb147de57aadb37358e41edc0f

There is a shift in the ecosystem from gaming for fun to becoming more of a social event, ie: hanging with friends *while* playing video games for the hobbyist gamer, and streaming for the professionals. Gaming, once thought to be an activity for the young, has proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults (214.4 million people) played video games ([source](https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/15/esa-ceo-64-of-u-s-adults-are-gamers-46-of-players-are-women-older-people-are-playing-more/))

https://preview.redd.it/mhmyyow5dx271.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ab577faef9b2abdd438edf9162b5e372a76063

&#x200B;

Check out evolution of streaming platforms since the Pandemic. Out of the top 3 competitors (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook) Twitch was the clear winner here with users streaming and revenues jumping significantly. This massive expansion of total addressable market (TAM) is most likely a one time occurrence, but the gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward.

**eSports**

Another beneficiary of the gaming industry boom, which is not talked about enough nor well-understood by many, are eSports. Essentially, eSports are gaming competitions that offer cash as prizes and draw YUGE crowds. The eSports industry alone is set to surpass \~1.1 billion in revenues in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020’s \~950 million. To put things in perspective some of the top eSports events compete with the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf tournaments where the winner takes home *millions* of dollars.

**Enters Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)? They are a designer and manufacturer of high-end gear for all things PC gaming. They offer four different segments of products, almost all of which have 5-star ratings on Amazon.

&#x200B;

1. PC peripherals: keyboards, headsets, mice, mousepads, chais, etc.
2. Streaming equipment: green screens, capture cards, microphones.
3. PC components: almost anything outside the graphics card that can be found inside the PC tower (the big metal box that the computer is made of).
4. Gaming PCs for those that don’t want to self-customize their own.

**Corsair - Outlook**

With the rise of gaming comes new opportunity for CRSR to expand its sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with \~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games ([source](https://fortunly.com/statistics/video-game-industry-statistics/)). This creates a very opportune market for those who can provide value to the PC gamer.

The target market who purchases peripherals are a passionate, well-researched group with access to many other brands. Therefore, only a well-liked (and popular) brand can succeed in this market ([source](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/gaming-peripheral-branding-data-brands-consumer-research/)). Thus, the market advantages large incumbents over smaller up-and-comers. Their brand value is also obvious in the premiums that their brand allows them to charge. Their gaming components and systems products, which they are currently the market leader, demands an average of \~40% premiums compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more, on average, than their competitors and they are still out-selling them.

**Final Thoughts**

Given the rapid growth of the gaming industry boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRSR is on track to capture a large segment of this growth and expand its business as a result. However, CRSR is not expected to have any massive shifts in its business nor do their growth strategies include any drastic changes to their current strategy. Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. Although they may not experience the same explosive from 2019 to 2020, they are in a great position to remain a market leader in a fast-growing industry.

**Positions:** None right now, but I've sold puts on CRSR over the last 6 months. Will be selling again on next red day.",DD,0.95

!! This is undiscovered NEWS so far !!

*The masses have not discovered this yet, so be fast!*

*This is not a financial advice.*

[The presentation was released and soon after this happened. Take into account that this is not news so far. There hasn't been mass coverage yet.](https://preview.redd.it/amwkymr4ea371.png?width=1753&format=png&auto=webp&s=de5a97b0c3941fcadd08846d9114d7f1e34f8083)

In brief: Nano Dimension (NNDM) creates machines that manufacture Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) with 3D printing technology. They have acquired Nano Fabrica which specializes in 3D printed mechanical components, and Deep Cube which specializes in Machine Learning, with the intention of making production of any product quicker, more efficient, and more precise. Deep Cube has collaborated with **AMD**.

In this presentation it is clear that Nano Dimension is collaborating with **NVIDIA** and **Neuralink** \- the **Elon Musk** singularity pursuit.

**This company and their technology is the future and at the same time** **speculative.**

1. 3D Nano Technology. If you haven't read the **Three Body Problem** book series, praised by Obama and the likes, please do. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Three-Body\_Problem\_(novel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel))
2. This technology is, frankly, the next step in humankinds technological advancement. It's still cocooning but NNDM is taking it forwards.
3. The company is based in Israel - a lot of fuckery in there in the past months -  but things seem to be getting better now.

[Since the All Time High - NNDM has acquired 2 companies, has increased their cash to +1B and has developed their technology even further and revealed some big name customers of theirs. Still the price is $10 less than when it was a more speculative stock.](https://preview.redd.it/hketqhsega371.png?width=1755&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea0dd7cae930fc9a3cc2781ba77c8460e4fc4a5)

**Shorts:**

1. According to Marketwatch, the Short interest of float is 11.68%
2. According to Fintel, the Short interest of float is 65%.
3. Go figure.
4. Regardless what people think, Cathie Wood is a great investor. She has been betting on NNDM for a while and praising their vision in the media. [https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-nndm](https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-nndm)

&#x200B;

**Final Words**I have tried to present to you the information that has driven my approach to NNDM and their potential without presenting too many biased thoughts.

My **biased** thought are, this is the fucking future, this company is going to take our technological advancement to the next level, towards scifi shit. In short, I love what they want to do, it will be a progress but I would love to fund their efforts, although I am an Europoor.

Since you want to know my positions anyway:

Entry point is as important as exit. RKT is trading at a generous $22.30 in AH action. It's still under it's price-point pre-earnings calls and far below the all-time-high of $43 (technically $48 as it hit that in AH trading). Some quick facts:

* RKT option calls are still cheap (IV is at reasonable levels)
* Option chain goes up to $58.89
* Last time RKT rocketed up, it went right to the top of the option chain
* Lots of potential tendies to be made, for example, $1,750 worth of $30 contracts could be worth $140K if it goes up to the top of the option chain ($58.89)
* Even buying shares can potentially lead to a nice 2.64x mutliple on your investment!

Why now?

* Bullish pattern in today's trading and is up 20% this week
* It's trading pattern has been independant of other meme stocks, suggesting a potential break out
* Positive retail sentiment = It's in the top 10 trending stocks on stocktwits
* It's close to an inclusion in the S&P 500 (Check this [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsanas/rkt_is_nearly_in_the_sp_500_did_some_research_and/) for more info)

Not to mention that RKT is fundamentally undervalued!

* Profitable each quarter
* P/E ratio of 4.8 vs 30+ for high growth companies in S&P 500
* Dominant market position and insulated against interest rates because they are a workflow platform for brokers and therefore earnings are based more on the number of brokers on their platform rather than other metrics for traditional mortgage companies

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

Now They're Doing a NASDAQ IPO with Fenwick &amp; West who Just Completed The COIN IPO!!!,"Obviously CLOV has gotten all the attention as of recent. CLOV was up 85% today and had volume over 732M. The reddit army has taken charge and sent CLOV to truly to the moon. 

I want to share what I think is lining up to be the next CLOV... 

Still largely under the radar is Vancouver based WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) which also has significant short interest, strong fundamentals , and billionaire backers. They just completed a $206M acquisition of “MyHealth” now making it the largest private clinic operator in Canada.

Just prior to that, the company recently announced the $372.9M Acquisition of CRH medical which significantly increased WELLs footprint in the US... This is where it gets interesting. Not only did JP Morgan extend there existing credit line to CRH medical by USD$100M to $300M and RBC provide a C$200M secured credit facility for the recent “MyHealth” acquisition. 

But the company legit partnered with Fenwick & West to assist with a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year.... Fenwick client base is Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and recently COIN... We are on a launch pad waiting to take off. 

Jumping into the charts now... WELL has consolidated for a year while they have exponentially grown the fundamentals of the business. Just recently they blew through every moving average.

This is a boomer-esque company with mega potential to squeeze AND these motherfuckers GIVE you money to buy their shares ($0.10 per share per quarter). At current share prices, that’s around 4% a year, which is MORE than the average mortgage interest rate right now. 

It’s being shorted because it went public with a spac, but the company has been around since the 80s.

Also there is a short interest of 20.5% of the float. Think about this:
- shorts have to PAY to hold their position
- holders get PAID to hold their position

Gamma squeeze potential:
- 100K open interest on 6/18 $10c
- translates to the buying of 10M shares if the stock closes above $10
- That translates to a pure BUY VOLUME double the average daily volume in one afternoon

1. Major shareholders have zero intention to sell as the company is extremely profitable and they even issued a $300M share buyback program that started in May 21.
2. Long holders will not sell, the stock is issuing a 4%+ dividend on July 6th and most of that will probably be auto-reinvested into the stock.  The company has Triple digit YOY growth and q1 2021 was the best ever.
3. There is a 22% short interest on float.  This is extremely high on a profitable company.
4.  The real reason this will squeeze is because the cost to borrow is a staggering 38%. Together with the love from long holders, the $300m share buyback program and high interest on every single stock message board, this is looking to be the absolutely best squeeze possibility. 

In fact Fintel has UWMC at a higher squeeze score than even CLOV.  We all saw what CLOV did.  Get in UWMC and make the dream come true.

UWMC,neetnp,2021-05-17 14:23:47,$200K all-in because I believe that $UWMC is undervalued. CEO agreed undervalued and declared a buyback to retire class A float (only class that gets dividends). BULLISH trend this week!," 

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

Revenues are in a heavy up-trend YOY, Extremely high revenue growth potential, profitable in the next 2-3 years, product diversification, and many more.

To me personally, the addition of Aphria was a great decision. Tilray is now a mega cannabis company. Aphria was the #1 cannabis company on the planet in terms of raw financial performance. These two powerhouse companies are going to lead the charge in medicinal cannabis.

Legislation appears to be in the favor of cannabis which will ultimately reverse this long term negative down-trend. With TLRY being the now industry leader, I believe they will benefit the most from favorable legislation.

&#x200B;

However, with all of those positive characteristics in mind, Tilray is being shorted to Shanghai. Why? Is it for the monetary gain of people who can afford to short companies?

The gaming sector as a whole is at all time highs. CRSR is arguably the industry leader in the type of hardware they produce. I AM NOT SAYING THIS IS A SHORT SQUEEZE……maybe a lil one. Unlike my wife’s boyfriend’s dick. The % of the float held by institutions is 81.04%. The short interest is 19.94%. Someone check my math but pretty sure that equals 100.98. Not enough wrinkles in my brain but seems like this should count for something, however small. On to the DD. 

•	Current share price $31.80. 

•	TTM P/E = 20.59x.

Introduced 29 new products in the first quarter and expect the product introduction to continue throughout the year with several brand new products to come. These products were released in the late in the quarter so their impact would not fully show up yet in Q1 financials. Lowered debt by 28MM and expect to continue reducing. Raised revenue projection for the year. Raised operating income projection for the year. Raised EBITDA projection for the year.

•	21Q1 beat analyst projections by $0.25

Comparables

Turtle Beach is trading at 11.29x and near ATH. Logitech trades at 24.03x and is at ATH. Now this is difficult for CRSR because they just IPO’d less than a year ago. P/E ratio will likely step more in line with next earnings. 

TL:DR $CRSR See no negatives whatsoever. Only thing that could possibly offer safer returns is ornamental gourds. Literally can’t go tits up. Not a financial advisor or analyst. I just like the stock. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Remember what happened the last time a stock had borrow rates this high? Everyone seems to be bashing CLOV as a distraction from other stocks but to me it looks like after the price spike yesterday the shorts have doubled down on their position.

Since CLOV reached its ATH from the activity yesterday new short positions had to be opened in order for hedge funds to prevent further losses. The shorts are already under a lot of pressure as the share price is higher than any of their previous short positions unlike all of the ""tHE neXt BiG sQwEEz"" plays you retards have been posting for the last 24 hours.

DD,nhmv7n,2021-05-21 09:40:32,FORD DD - $F - Don't worry about debt,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

AMC,nnpn9z,2021-05-29 17:21:20,AMC &amp; GME Price Action Comparison before their squeeze,"What's going on y'all

&#x200B;

Just want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze

&#x200B;

So as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC. Now this got me thinking and made me want to look back at the history of how GME started to move before it's squeeze.

&#x200B;

If you look at the candles closely, they are very very alot alike

&#x200B;

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it.

BB:
60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don’t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
🚀🚀🚀


I wouldn’t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren’t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it’s actually a good thing that there’s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That’s some fat margin.

Now, you’re probably wondering…wtf, I’m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you’re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you’re sitting? Well that’s probably a Sony camera…or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean…my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it’s a tiny slab of glass and my family can’t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they’ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who’s probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I’m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what’s interesting about Ford’s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means…even if Ford can’t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that’s VW’s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder…what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren’t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It’s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That’s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there’s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs…Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don’t mean Volvo Cars. That’s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I’m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It’s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there’s Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

WISH,nqkzbc,2021-06-02 14:46:43,WISH Institutional Share Increase with Open Puts.,"I heard you like DD and bear hunting so here's the big reveal. &amp;gt;!Sometimes the bear is the bull.!&amp;lt;

**Source:** reading through 13F Filings of hedgies

**On this episode of Who Owns These Puts?**

Our robot Edgar or Marvin, whatever you want to call him... dropped us GOLD! Through some digging on all 13F filings recently, there is only 1 big owner for the over 9000 $WISH puts that expire very soon. From there we find the inner workings of a rocket in assembly that we must sit in on before they launch. Talk about free lunch.

**Current short float:** \&amp;gt;10%

**Who do you think it is?** Melvin? Citadel? Guess again, it's &amp;gt;!Sus-quana (SIG)!&amp;lt;

**Who else would hold this ""sus"" position?**

**Exhibit A:** Who owns $16m in puts?

https://preview.redd.it/iyv4zpcilu271.png?width=1304&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ce70b5867f585a9cff56d515ea87fcd78c90e769

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit B:** 5/17 filing over 9000 OI, the only possible culprit for 6/18 expirations

https://preview.redd.it/ozzqetdjlu271.png?width=2175&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ee3375750adab580e2cc4d97c4b14e7cdc06584f

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit C:** 3/26/2021 Sus owns 420,000 shares and around 2000 puts to hedge possibly (Not sure who bought those shares but he/she probably likes 420.)

3/26 13F Filing (At the time \~$16/share)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit D:** 5/17 Sus now owns 1,188,000 shares, up 2.2x or 768,000 shares in 3 months.

5/17 13F Filing (At the time \~$9/share)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Questions?**

But wait didn't they buy from $16 to $9, and $15 put with 9000 contracts open? So are they long or are they short?

**1.**) Sus is now a bag holder of WISH at \~ $12, trading at $7.74, that would mean a $4m+ loss on paper if they were to close out. (LONG BAG HOLDER)

**2.**) $15put with 9000 contracts. What a coincidence, owning shares at \~$16. Did someone open a position to push the price down?

It's quite possible that they shorted the price down to buy more shares while holding puts. (Long bag holder and accumulating more shares.)

**3.**)Let's see what hedgy friend is doing. \*enters Citadel

**Exhibit E**: 2/16 Citadel owns roughly 69,000 shares (Price at time $25)

https://preview.redd.it/kkqxrz5mlu271.png?width=2140&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f06df0e7273958c79a5bb4eea63e0c7fbd2790a6

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit F:** 5/17 Citadel owns roughly 926,000 shares, 13x increase or +857000 shares(Price at time $8.74)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**: Maybe hedgies just made a bad investment and they averaged down? (Sure it's possible, but what are they going to do with all the shares?) Wrong! Push down price, buy more shares, rocketship, profit. Hedgies are about to lift off a rocket secretly but we just got **access to the sneak peak before it goes!**

**TLDR**: When bulls wear bear clothing. Ride them. Wish pummeled so shares can be acquired.

**Position:** Original 5000 shares @ $7.8

Closed. Bought into GME.

RNG,nthp3b,2021-06-06 11:11:28,"DD RNG potential if compared with Hydrogen &amp; BEVs, USA (California) regulatory and legislative focus","Hello everyone, 

here a DD focused on RNG and Natural Gas developments in the USA, as previous one was more broad and had the intention to outline the state of the industry worldwide.

As you may know, California has always been at the center of attention as the most advanced state in terms of decarbonization efforts. Yet, it seems that not all decisions paid back in terms of quality of life and certainty of business activity.

**Californian** **Natural Gas power plants shut down, electricity imported from other states:**

Indeed, California, different from what someone would expect, has not a good and reliable supply of electricity, probably because it pushed too aggressively for the state's 100% electrification goal (see attached picture). During the most recent blackout in August 2020, some Electric buses were forced to shut down, in order to reduce electricity demand. In the next decade, virtual power plants' alike experiments will be more popular, therefore it is reasonable to expect a better match between the demand & supply of green electricity. But it will take time and for safety reasons, it would be better to rely on different sources of energy.

* [2020-08-21 Washington Examiner: California forced to defend green goals amid blackouts](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-forced-to-defend-green-goals-amid-blackouts)
* [2020-08-23 Oil & Gas 360 : Green California has the nation's worst power grid](https://www.oilandgas360.com/green-california-has-the-nations-worst-power-grid/)

The first question that arises, reading these topics, is about the never-ending announcements of companies like Nikola $NKLA (very dubious business potential) and Tesla $TSLA (amazing company with incredible potential) about the incoming, quick and easy electrification of Heavy Duty Transports.

**Hydrogen Alternative Focus**

Nikola revealed its lack of technological breakthrough when it was revealed that General Motors had the intention to market a Hydrogen trucks with the Nikola brand and...... GM Fuel Cells!! The drama related to the CEO trials made the rest. I am a huge fan of hydrogen , but as Cummins $CMI CEO confirmed, hydrogen trucks have a long long way to go before being adopted on a large scale (please note that [Cummins acquired Hydrogenics in Sept. 2019](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2019/09/09/cummins-closes-its-acquisition-hydrogenics) (second global leader after $BLDP in hydrogen fuel cells). According to Cummins and others, in the next years electrolyzer segment will grow first. Note that the hydrogen fuel needed for hypothetical trucks on California's road would need green hydrogen, thus it will put more stress on the grid.. Even if it is not focused on the US, I recommend readers this report of David Fickling about global green hydrogen potential by 2050. 

[According to David Fickling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-hydrogen-economys-time-is-approaching/2020/05/08/383b1a04-9191-11ea-9322-a29e75effc93_story.html), hydrogen could meet 24% of the world’s energy needs by 2050, but it would likely take 31’320 TWh of electricity to hit this level. Last year, the entire world generated just roughly 26’000 TWh, of which 10’000 were coming from zero-carbon sources. By 2050 it may be achievable, but there are shorter deadlines for the transport sector. Actions today are required to match 2025 and 2030 emission targets.

If we want a high percentage of **green hydrogen**, a huge amount of grid investments is required today; high-tension grid infrastructure needs 5-10 years to be completed, therefore it is reasonable to say that hydrogen will be a sound reality for mobility from the late 2020’s on, not earlier. In addition, the potential of exhausted salt mines that could store hydrogen for months is just theoretical for now.

It is worth to remember that the sources for electricity generation in Europe are diversified and are not ready for a 100% renewable energy scenario:

* **Germany renounced to nuclear power** in 2011 and will renounce to coal by 2030, and the country is massively investing in gas pipelines, so it is very likely that it will not renounce to Russian gas.
* **France relies heavily on nuclear power**, with some of these power plants being soon too old to remain active. Therefore, traditional gas generation will be a  likely alternative to overcome this problem.
* **The UK closed all its coal power plants** but decided to keep open nuclear and gas facilities.
* **Italy** relies heavily on gas and does not have any nuclear power plant.

None of Europe’s largest countries can afford a 100% green electricity sector that can satisfy both current demand plus the incremental demand coming from the green hydrogen sector. Therefore, some fossil fuel (natural gas) and nuclear plants are here to stay for the longer term.

**BLUE HYDROGEN CANNOT BE IGNORED -** The argument is different if we include in the discussion blue hydrogen along with carbon capture. In this scenario, we would need massive incentives and research investments in carbon capture technology, which now are still at an early stage. According to the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, [who spoke at the World Economic Forum in January 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/c93694c8-3d15-11ea-a01a-bae547046735), the EU will define the structure of a continental carbon tax by the end of this year (pre-COVID-19 intention, very likely now that the details will be published in 2021). For this reason, large trade partners like the US and China were advised to start their own studies on the tax, if they do not want their goods to be taxed at the highest possible carbon emission rate.

**HYDROGEN TRAIN FOCUS** \- An interesting case in this regard is the Hydrogen train developed by Alstom and Hydrogenics (now Cummins Inc.) whose adoption has been delayed considerably. Alstom was able to sell its innovative product to some German and French regions. Nevertheless, in most of the cases hydrogen will come from fossil sources (Rhyne region etc.), with cleaner alternatives being provided at a later stage. In the region of Schleswig Holstein, where the green potential was massive, Alstom could have got the greatest commercial order for a hydrogen product worldwide; however, the green fueling station was at the heart of a controversy between the company and the tender offer authorities of Schleswig-Holstein. For this reason, 52 trains were allocated to the battery train manufacturer and the Alstom (Hydrogenics) & NEL consortium lost the tender offer. The proposed fueling station was massive for the time, being around 20 MW capacity, [but the cost of it was at the expense of the consortium](https://www.ln-online.de/Lokales/Lauenburg/Aus-fuer-die-Wasserstoffzelle-auf-der-Schiene).

**BEV Infrastructure focus**

Tesla instead kept postponing the launch of its Tesla SEMI. You can read again the last conference call transcripts which clearly states that the biggest issue from a product perspective is the fast charger technology, whose time of realization and commercialization is yet unknown. From a macro perspective instead is unclear how California may afford to charge thousands of Tesla SEMI with its current electricity grid.

**How does $CLNE fits into all this?**

 If you look at 2020 Q2 CC of $CLNE , management made a quite useful comparison for H2 fueling stations and BEV charging stations for heavy-duty. They told the story of a recharging facility in Los Angeles that was going to be built for $5.5 million to recharge 24 heavy-duty trucks in a day’s time, in like 20-hour time, using the equivalent of the electricity needed for 44’000 homes (!!!). Thus, it is reasonable to expect not many fleet operators to switch soon to BEV trucks. 

About hydrogen refueling, management commented on the experience they got operating a hydrogen station in California with on-site hydrogen generation through electrolysis:

“*Get a load of this, it requires about 20 gallons of water (each gallon is 3.785 liters) for every gallon of hydrogen you produce. So march that out on a nationwide scale. And the idea that we're going to do it with renewable sources at a station is going to be very daunting, okay?*

*I think that as you look at commercial truck stops with hydrogen, you're probably looking at something on the order of $15 million to $20 million, or more, per station. So this is a very expensive proposition because you're basically creating a whole new network. And really, the most successful stations around the world, and there's only a handful of hydrogen, is you're reforming natural gas.”*

It is clear why some fleet operators are switching to Natural Gas Trucks. Amazon in February and the Port of LA recently, with the decision to equate BEV and other Zero Emission trucks to the Natural Gas ones. 

**US Congress ""Californification"" , not so fast**

In the past legislative period, there were some bipartisan attempts to support RNG and Natural Gas mobility. US Congress has indeed shown some interest in the subject. Last June, a bipartisan effort was introduced in both the chambers of the US congress. The bill is called “[Growing Climate Solutions Act](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/10/growing-climate-solutions-act-gives-farmers-a-seat-at-the-carbon-market-table/)” and would allow farmers to generate revenue streams from different forms of carbon capture. Most notably, methane from livestock is mentioned in the legislation. If enacted at  the federal level, decarbonized gas would receive a renovated interest from many different stakeholders. [Being a bipartisan deal](https://www.audubon.org/news/indiana-senator-mike-braun-discusses-bipartisan-climate-solutions-young-leaders), as farmers represent a prized electoral category, it should be enacted regardless of the next election results.

President Biden needs to show to his party and the American people that he is doing something about the environment. That is why he advertised the Ford BEV pickup and keeps saying that government's fleets will be electrified. As always, the political reality is much more complex than the headline announcements, and RNG has a lot of room to grow in this space. 

[Already in 2020, RNG represented 53% of all Natural Gas used in transport in the USA](https://bioenergyinternational.com/markets-finance/rng-surpassed-ng-accounting-for-53-percent-of-us-on-road-ngv-fuel-use-in-2020) . As noted in a previous DD, in California RNG is 90% of NG used in transport.

#Hello shitheads and aspiring shitheads.  It is time to get into cow farts.  *(If you aren’t already. 😉)*


I needed a new play to continue this meme high, and one stood out above the rest, mostly because it has something that gets me all hot and bothered but may frighten and baffle my fellow primates:  

A goddamn date.  *(I know, you’re not used to getting them.)*   
**>>>>June 18th<<<<**


There’s also shit involved, which is just a bonus.


#THE SHIT  
Clean Energy Fuels ($CLNE) specializes in renewable natural gas. Like all good RNG, renewable natural gas is about taking a bunch of random (and literal) bullshit and turning it into beautiful loot.  
In this case, they are grinding for methane. From all the 🐄💨. It’s poot loot.


This is the most natural (ha!) step for the juggernaut initiative that is Green Energy which is coming nation-wide circa 2030 one way or another, even if the rest of the industry is still trying to work out an actual plan.  CLNE is ahead of the game. While 🍦🕶🇺🇸 and co. are trying to decide how much of the country can actually run on all-electric, CLNE is securing deals with a little company called AMZN and securing some huge long term revenue.


#THE (GAMMA) SQUEEZE  
I can’t believe you made it all the way through that last section on only five emoji.  Good boy! Here’s some treats before I go on.  🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌


So what is special about this stock and why the date?  
Well, some rubes went and built a Goldberg machine out of options expiring on 6/18.  If this thing goes off, there will be so much gamma squeezed out that your new green dildo will make Bruce Banner feel inadequate.
  

CLNE has a float of 145 million and had been sitting, flatter than your wife’s boyfriend’s abs, at around $8 for the past month, consolidating and getting all pent up like you when the missus goes on her weeklong trips “to the grocery store”.  
Prior to yesterday’s open, it had an open interest of 47,000 in 6/18 calls with strikes between $9 and $15.  
As of typing, that range now has 69,000 OI (nice!), 65,000 OTM, which means the squeeze potential has only increased with yesterday’s activity.
The most striking (HA!) of these numbers is the 29,000 calls aimed at a share price of $13.


Sure seems like someone knows or is planning something I don’t know about...  Either way, it is set to go off, like you when the missus...


Even before hitting that lucky number 13, calls representing 26 million shares, **18%** of the float and **500%** of the 10-day average volume prior to yesterday, should be hedged.  When it hits $13, 29 million more shares in calls become ITM and the volume beast will begin shitting out green dildos that it will consume to shit more in a shit ouroboros that will fuel the ape shit ship back to the moon.  💩🚀💩🚀💩🚀💩🚀💩🚀  
Yesterday was just a preview of what will happen as more of those strikes are reached. The daily volume exceeded **600%** of the previous 10-day average and that resulted of a share price high of $9.74, **19%** higher than previous close. 

#THE PLAY  
Okay, fair warning, this part pains me to write a bit because it almost doesn’t seem like a bet, but the most safe method, and what will fuel the squeeze, is to buy and HODL shares.  You should know the drill by now. 


The reason shares won’t quite scratch the gambling itch is because CLNE’s ATH of $19 happened just back in February, and it hasn’t dipped far below its current level in five months. [It also has a price target of somewhere between $17 to $18, depending on the analyst.  ](https://finance.yahoo.com/research/stock-forecast/CLNE?symbols=CLNE&ncid=qsprelated_bl1fruji100)  
This means that even with its recent rise, there is not much downside, and the upside is huge even if the gamma squeeze does not play out.  The feeling of holding is not quite the same when there is no apparent risk of your bags being -50% for a quarter of a year before you can break even, I know, but hopefully you can find a way to adjust to all the green in your portfolio.


Shares also benefit from a possible raincheck of the scheduled event should 6/18 fail to deliver.  
While not quite as ideal, 9/17 calls have a whopping 20,881 open interest at the $20 strike which could grow into a similar situation should lower strike interest grow.  There is currently an OI of about 29,000 in the run up range from $10-$19 but it is not so nice and evenly distributed as it is on our magic date.  Worth watching though.

Overall, shares should securely keep your tits below you, if that is how you like them.


Options are where the biggest upside is going to be, and boy is there a lot of potential.  Thanks to CLNE’s month long power nap, premiums ~~are~~ were stupidly low for calls 6/18 strikes $13 and above.  A light breeze is all it took to make some of those ten baggers yesterday.  They still have plenty of room to run and premiums are still somewhat modest, all things considered.  Triggering the squeeze would send these to high heaven.

#TL;DR
Gamma squeeze. CLNE. 6/18.

WANT,nni8bn,2021-05-29 09:37:06,WANT TO RETIRE QUICKER? HERE'S HOW!,"$$$ HOW TO MAKE MONEY OFF THE WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE $$$

&#x200B;

\*\*\* If you aren't in TSM ( ***Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing***) you hate money. Here are some reasons you should look into this stock and buy it before it is too late. \*\*\*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Economics 101, Supply and Demand.**

* TSM is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world
* THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE
* Let me emphasize this point. THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE

As many of you know, there is a worldwide semiconductor shortage (yes I said it again). These semiconductors are vital components in every electronic we use today. Without these semiconductors, things like smartphones, automobiles, video game consoles, etc. Would not be able to function.

(Read the following if you want to see why these semiconductors are so vital...or just completely trust me, that's fine too)

***\*ALL COMPUTERS NEEDS SEMICONDUCTORS TO FUNCTION\****

Semiconductors are used primarily in electronic devices, including chips, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. According to Goldman Sachs 169 industries rely on semiconductors. Anything that is computerized or uses radio waves depends on semiconductors. Your phone is a computer, your car is a computer, your video game consoles are computers, your amazon firestick is a computer, every aspect of your life is dependent on these semiconductors.

TSM PRODUCES THESE CHIPS FOR THE FOLLWOING COMPANIES AND MANY MORE:
-Apple
-Toyota
-NVIDIA
-AMD
-SO MANY MORE

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you believe the future of automobiles are powered by electric? Not without semiconductors.

**Semiconductors in Automobiles**

1. **Vehicle electrification –** Semiconductors have made it possible to replace manual systems with electrical systems. Electrification of key systems provides benefits such as increased vehicle efficiency, reductions in carbon emissions, and minimizing oil dependency.
2. **Safety and driver assistance –** The increasing need for better safety and driver assistance systems in cars has provided a niche for semiconductors. Intelligent functions such as backup cameras, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, airbag deployment, and emergency braking systems are all made possible through the integration of semiconductor technologies.
3. **Connectivity –** Cars are increasingly incorporating technology that improves their connectivity. New vehicles on the market include ever-more sophisticated telematics (long-distance data transmission) and infotainment capabilities which feed drivers information on factors such as road closures, collision avoidance, and even free parking spaces at their destination. On-board computers which handle this information have to process millions of lines of code every second. Semiconductors allow cars to stay connected in real-time.

Semiconductors are key to the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry as they help to control the powertrain and battery. Semiconductors are also used in the variety of touchscreens that are installed in the driver’s dash and in the back of passenger seats.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINANCIALS/NEWS**

* Financially, the company has reported its third straight quarter of record sales in its first-quarter earnings report back in April.
* Its revenue came in 25.4% higher year-over-year to 12.9 billion.
* The stock has more than doubled in price over the past year
* Japan’s government recently announced that it wants TSM and Sony to invest $9.2 billion to build the country’s first 20-nanometer chip plant.
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said on Friday (5/21/2021) that it has increased its 2021 output for a key component for automotive semiconductors by 60% compared with last year, amid a global chip shortage.

These are just a couple of things. If This has caught your eye please research TSM on your own and you can find more great news and financial statements...or don't, you've made it this far, might as well go all in.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.

BB,nrdbzc,2021-06-03 15:19:23,"Once upon a time, I was a BB factory worker. BB saved my life. It might do so again.","Hey All,

&#x200B;

So I'm brand new to WSB but bear with me. Once upon a time, when I was very down on my luck, I walked into a temp agency and asked for any job they could give me. What they had was a factory assembly worker on the line at Blackberry in my hometown of Waterloo, Canada (yep...Canadian alert!). It was a 12hr job with day/night swapping shifts. It was a repetative, monotonous job putting screws into things and doing it all in style in a zero static white suit and blue boots. It was most definitely NOT what I had envisioned for myself for the rest of my life. However, that job would turn out to be one of the most rewarding short-term jobs I've ever had because I sat next to some truly wonderful people on the assembly line.

With nothing to do for 12hrs but shoot the sh\*t, I soon discovered that I was sitting next to doctors from Iran, lawyers from Indonesia, CEOs from Pakistan. Each of them had come to this job out of desperation just like me. Each of them were deemed ""overqualified"" by most other jobs just like me. Each of them had worked hard, invested in company shares (BB had an amazing employee share program) and had made more money there than they could have dreamed. BB had given them the promise of a real future in Canada and you could see the passion they had for this company in their faces. Also, BB once a year rented out the Air Canada Centre (or Rogers or whatever the hell its called now...) and rented a rock band for their employees! Like...ALL of their employees...not just management. I saw ACDC, Steven Tyler, Van Halen and the Tragically Hip. All thanks to BB. They wanted to spread the love.

So I got over myself and how I wasn't where I wanted to be, and I used this job to give myself a crash-course on global politics from the amazing people I worked with. I learned about the so-called ""scary"" parts of the world and how beautiful they actually were. When the time came to leave that job and move on to other things, I left with a profound appreciation for hard-working immigrants and just how much dedication it takes to sit down at a factory bench with a $200k salary potential education, and screw things together for $14/hr. I'll never forget those people. And I'll never forget that company. Blackberry gave life, employment, education grants, city improvements and other amazing opportunities to my hometown of Waterloo. When the time came that Apple overtook them and Blackberry faltered, my hometown and the rest of Canada turned its back on them, and that disgusted me.

THAT is why I am investing in BB today. Not for a get-rich-quick scheme, but because I genuinely hold a special place in my heart for that company and can find way more emotional attachment to it than a TV channel I used to watch, and a place where I used to buy Ace Combat as a kid.

TLDR; BB was once the bright future of Canadian tech industry, it carried me through tough times as an employee, and I respect it.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*Update: Wow folks! What a day. I've never had a harder time trying to NOT look at my phone while looking after the baby as the wife was at the salon. You guys were so thoughtful and supportive today and I truly appreciate all the gifts, karma, props and personal stories. I was even stoked to find some fellow KW/RIM employees in the mix! So happy to see that this community is alive and well. I continue to value BB as a future major player and I'll hold my shares because I truly believe in what this company can do, and how we can help it succeed.

To the folks that thought I was a corporate plant or some sketchy conspiracy, I giggled a bit. I can assure you I'm a regular dude and this was a regular post. I hold a very MODEST amount of BB shares because that's all I can afford, but I know other folks invested heavily and I wish them the very best of success in the weeks and months to follow. As always, I can't give any financial advice. I'm not a pro. All I can say is invest in something you truly believe in - not just because it can make you rich. I'm a proud Canadian first and foremost, and I can't wait to see how this company can exceed all of our expectations no matter where we happen to live.

All the best friends!!! Thanks for making today one of the coolest and craziest days of my Reddit life! Much love to all of you :) BB to the moon!!!!

\*\*UPDATE #2:  For all the posters who doubted that I actually held BB stock, here's a screenshot of the only three stocks I hold - BB, AMC (but I think I'll sell tomorrow for BB), and EMO.V (a really undervalued Canadian mining stock - I know \*yawn\*- but I've been holding for seven years and its finally moving!)

PSLV,napgpn,2021-05-12 16:04:51,"The market is giving us an absolute gift with these inflation numbers, it’s time to load up the truck, PSLV","We’ve got a massive overshoot on inflation, coming in at 0.8% month over month versus 0.2% expected.

Annualized that’s a 10% inflation rate.

Year over year core CPI came in at 3%. The last time we had a yearly core CPI at 3% was 1996 and the fed funds rate was 5%, not 0%.  The last time we had monthly core CPI advancing this quickly was 1980.

So what is the reaction among gold and silver, the traditional inflation hedge plays? They are selling off and the dollar is rallying.

Why? The market is now pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike, despite the insistence of the fed that there won’t be one.

Once they digest that rate hikes won’t happen, this is the next black swan.

Will JPow spit in the face of a market that is fully pricing in a rate hike?  Usually the fed likes to go along with market expectations rather than shock the system.

I believe they won’t raise rates or signal that rate hikes are coming soon.

We still require massive fed and fiscal support to keep the economy and market from crashing, and they will choose the economy over keeping inflation in check.

What happens to the dollar when a 100% priced in expectation doesn’t happen?  Eventually the market is going to realize rates are staying at 0% regardless of inflation.

When this sets in, gold and silver are going to uncharted heights.

Silver is essentially levered gold. Look at my profile and find the stickied SLV post, read past the part bashing SLV and you’ll see silver is the investment to dump 20% of your big boy money into to save yourself this decade.

In most decades equities will massively outperform metals. Every few decades the opposite occurs. In the last two silver bull markets silver outperformed equities by 40x and 25x respectively during their 10 year run ups.

Look at the 50-year cup and handle forming on silver, and tell me it’s not a screaming buy:

&#x200B;

Load up the truck, mortgage the house, buy PSLV

Alternatives: buy physical silver if you don’t care about liquidity (keep premiums below 20%), buy silver miners for even more leverage, buy options on miners for even more leverage. Just don’t touch the scam that is SLV.

Play it how you like, but please, if you have some ‘set it and forget’ type of money, put 20% into gold or silver through the 2020s. You can sell it at the end of the decade if you want to.  This sub has a habit of pure momentum trading, if someone suggests a ticker, every ape looks it up and if it’s already massively green they jump on the train. This is an opportunity to jump on a train before it’s running.

There is very little free floating silver in 1000oz bar form, and the [LBMA just spoofed 10% of it out of existence ](https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/ronan-manly/lbma-misleads-silver-market-with-false-claims-about-record-silver-stocks/). Look at lumber, rhodium, palladium. That’s what happens when supply runs out and shorts are forced to continuously cover in a commodities market.  This can easily happen in silver.

If you read that article you'll realize that when WSB piled into SLV in early Feb, that actually did nothing because SLV didn't go out and buy the silver.  They sold us paper lies and then their authorized participants shorted futures.  We have since learned that SLV is a scam and are buying PSLV and physical.  No more wool over the sheep's eyes.  We are coming for the metal, and taking the little silver that there is.  Banks who are massively net short can come begging later this decade at $500 an oz

Things in SPCE's favor

1. Today's flight was the first from the new Space Port America....the long term operational home
2. Paid flight with [Italian Air Force](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-and-italian-air-force-announce-world-first-government-contract-for-human-tended-research-flight/) is still on the schedule for 2022
3. Sir Richard's maiden voyage will like now take place THIS YEAR, lowering the concerns for other eccentric billionaires to go for a joy ride
4. There are at least [8,000 flights](https://www.manufacturing.net/aerospace/news/21118425/virgin-galactic-8000-have-placed-space-flight-reservation) already reserved which equals at least $2B (8,000x 250,000) in locked in future revenue, and the assumption is that if commercial flights start in 2022, new bookings will start much higher up
5. Based on this year's previous stock price the current $21.22 HAS to be oversold by at least 20-25%...I'm thinking it opens at $25/share on Monday
